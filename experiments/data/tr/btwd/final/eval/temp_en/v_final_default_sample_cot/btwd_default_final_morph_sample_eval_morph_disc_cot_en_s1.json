Your task is to determine whether the derived word is grammatically correct. First, analyze how the suffixes interact with the word root. Then, assess the order in which the suffixes are applied and verify that this order adheres to the language's rules. Think step by step and answer with Yes or No, placing your response within angle brackets. Example: <Yes> or <No>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: film\nSuffixes: nden, nde, ler, i, ki\nDerived word: filmlerindekinden\nAnswer: First, \"ler\" then \"i\", \"nde\", \"ki\" and \"nden\" are applied to the root \"film\". According to Turkish grammar rules, this order of suffixes is allowed and the derived word \"filmlerindekinden\" roughly translates to \"from those that are in their films\" in English. Hence, the derived word is grammatically correct. <Yes>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: bilgi\nSuffixes: len, il, si, me, dir\nDerived word: bilgilenmedirilsi\nAnswer:",
