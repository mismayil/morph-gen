Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given suffixes to the root. Use each suffix exactly once. After forming a word, list each suffix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no suffix is used more than once, confirm that all provided suffixes are used, verify that no extra suffixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and present the correctly formed word enclosed in angle brackets. Example: <correctword>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: birlikte\nSuffixes: liğ, imiz\nAnswer: The suffixes given are \"liğ\" and \"imiz\". By appending the suffixes in the correct order to the word root \"birlikte\", we can get the word \"birlikteliğimiz\" which is grammatically correct and roughly translates to \"our togetherness\" in English. The provided suffixes are used only once. No extra suffixes are included. The word complies with all the rules. <birlikteliğimiz>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: hayran\nSuffixes: ım, lığ\nAnswer:",

Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given suffixes to the root. Use each suffix exactly once. After forming a word, list each suffix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no suffix is used more than once, confirm that all provided suffixes are used, verify that no extra suffixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and present the correctly formed word enclosed in angle brackets. Example: <correctword>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: tanrı\nSuffixes: ma, sal, ı, laş, tır, ıl, dığ\nAnswer: The suffixes given are \"ma\", \"sal\", \"ı\", \"laş\", \"tır\", \"ıl\", and \"dığ\". By appending the suffixes in the correct order to the word root \"tanrı\", we get the word \"tanrısallaştırılmadığı\" which is grammatically correct and roughly translates to \"the fact that it was not made to be god-like\" in English. The provided suffixes are used only once. No extra suffixes are included. The word complies with all the rules. <tanrısallaştırılmadığı>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: anla\nSuffixes: t, lar, ın, ma, a, dık, ım\nAnswer:",
