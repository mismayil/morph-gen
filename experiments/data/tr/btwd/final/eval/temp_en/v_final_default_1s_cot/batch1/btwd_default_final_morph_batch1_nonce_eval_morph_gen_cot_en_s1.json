Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given suffixes to the root. Use each suffix exactly once. After forming a word, list each suffix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no suffix is used more than once, confirm that all provided suffixes are used, verify that no extra suffixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and present the correctly formed word enclosed in angle brackets. Example: <correctword>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: hüdin\nDefinition: hüdin means geçin in Turkish.\nSuffixes: ir, ken\nAnswer: The suffixes given are \"ir\" and \"ken\". By appending the suffixes in the correct order to the word root \"hüdin\" which is defined to mean \"geçin\" in Turkish, we can get the word \"hüdinirken\" which is grammatically correct and roughly translates to \"while getting by\" in English. The provided suffixes are used only once. No extra suffixes are included. The word complies with all the rules. <hüdinirken>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: segpü\nDefinition: segpü means güçlü in Turkish.\nSuffixes: ler, dür\nAnswer:",

Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given suffixes to the root. Use each suffix exactly once. After forming a word, list each suffix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no suffix is used more than once, confirm that all provided suffixes are used, verify that no extra suffixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and present the correctly formed word enclosed in angle brackets. Example: <correctword>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: hüdin\nDefinition: hüdin means geçin in Turkish.\nSuffixes: ir, ken\nAnswer: The suffixes given are \"ir\" and \"ken\". By appending the suffixes in the correct order to the word root \"hüdin\" which is defined to mean \"geçin\" in Turkish, we can get the word \"hüdinirken\" which is grammatically correct and roughly translates to \"while getting by\" in English. The provided suffixes are used only once. No extra suffixes are included. The word complies with all the rules. <hüdinirken>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: çezey\nDefinition: çezey means birey in Turkish.\nSuffixes: sel, ci\nAnswer:",

Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given suffixes to the root. Use each suffix exactly once. After forming a word, list each suffix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no suffix is used more than once, confirm that all provided suffixes are used, verify that no extra suffixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and present the correctly formed word enclosed in angle brackets. Example: <correctword>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: hüdin\nDefinition: hüdin means geçin in Turkish.\nSuffixes: ir, ken\nAnswer: The suffixes given are \"ir\" and \"ken\". By appending the suffixes in the correct order to the word root \"hüdin\" which is defined to mean \"geçin\" in Turkish, we can get the word \"hüdinirken\" which is grammatically correct and roughly translates to \"while getting by\" in English. The provided suffixes are used only once. No extra suffixes are included. The word complies with all the rules. <hüdinirken>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: yünmes\nDefinition: yünmes means herkes in Turkish.\nSuffixes: in, ki\nAnswer:",

Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given suffixes to the root. Use each suffix exactly once. After forming a word, list each suffix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no suffix is used more than once, confirm that all provided suffixes are used, verify that no extra suffixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and present the correctly formed word enclosed in angle brackets. Example: <correctword>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: hüdin\nDefinition: hüdin means geçin in Turkish.\nSuffixes: ir, ken\nAnswer: The suffixes given are \"ir\" and \"ken\". By appending the suffixes in the correct order to the word root \"hüdin\" which is defined to mean \"geçin\" in Turkish, we can get the word \"hüdinirken\" which is grammatically correct and roughly translates to \"while getting by\" in English. The provided suffixes are used only once. No extra suffixes are included. The word complies with all the rules. <hüdinirken>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: rarcu\nDefinition: rarcu means vurgu in Turkish.\nSuffixes: la, mış\nAnswer:",

After forming a word, list each suffix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no suffix is used more than once, confirm that all provided suffixes are used, verify that no extra suffixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and present the correctly formed word enclosed in angle brackets. Example: <correctword>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: ökişde\nDefinition: ökişde means ilerle in Turkish.\nSuffixes: e, ler, t, me, in\nAnswer: The suffixes given are \"e\", \"ler\", \"t\", \"me\", and \"in\". By appending the suffixes in the correct order to the word root \"ökişde\" which is defined to mean \"ilerle\" in Turkish, we can get the word \"ökişdetmelerine\" which is grammatically correct and roughly translates to \"to their advancings\" in English. The provided suffixes are used only once. No extra suffixes are included.
