Think step by step and answer with Yes or No, placing your response within angle brackets. Example: <Yes> or <No>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: ökişde\nDefinition: ökişde means ilerle in Turkish.\nSuffixes: in, me, ler, e, t\nDerived word: ökişdetmelerine\nAnswer: First, \"t\" then \"me\", \"ler\", \"in\" and \"e\" are applied to the root \"ökişde\" which is defined to mean \"ilerle\" in Turkish. According to Turkish grammar rules, this order of suffixes is allowed and the derived word \"ökişdetmelerine\" roughly translates to \"to their advancings\" in English. Hence, the derived word is grammatically correct. <Yes>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: çekün\nDefinition: çekün means düşün in Turkish.\nSuffixes: m, m, e, iyor, du\nDerived word: çekünemiyordum\nAnswer:",

Think step by step and answer with Yes or No, placing your response within angle brackets. Example: <Yes> or <No>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: içüm\nDefinition: içüm means ölüm in Turkish.\nSuffixes: me, süz, leş, il, si, tir\nDerived word: içümsüzleştirilmesi\nAnswer: First, \"süz\" then \"leş\", \"tir\", \"il\", \"me\" and \"si\" are applied to the root \"içüm\" which is defined to mean \"ölüm\" in Turkish. According to Turkish grammar rules, this order of suffixes is allowed and the derived word \"içümsüzleştirilmesi\" roughly translates to \"its immortalization\" in English. Hence, the derived word is grammatically correct. <Yes>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: balol\nDefinition: balol means ol in Turkish.\nSuffixes: uş, tur, dir, im, miş, abil\nDerived word: baloluşturabilmişimdir\nAnswer:",

Think step by step and answer with Yes or No, placing your response within angle brackets. Example: <Yes> or <No>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: ıgram\nDefinition: ıgram means anlam in Turkish.\nSuffixes: ıl, sız, tır, laş, ı, nın, dığ\nDerived word: ıgramsızlaştırıldığının\nAnswer: First, \"sız\" then \"laş\", \"tır\", \"ıl\", \"dığ\", \"ı\" and \"nın\" are applied to the root \"ıgram\" which is defined to mean \"anlam\" in Turkish. According to Turkish grammar rules, this order of suffixes is allowed and the derived word \"ıgramsızlaştırıldığının\" roughly translates to \"of that it has been rendered meaningless\" in English.
