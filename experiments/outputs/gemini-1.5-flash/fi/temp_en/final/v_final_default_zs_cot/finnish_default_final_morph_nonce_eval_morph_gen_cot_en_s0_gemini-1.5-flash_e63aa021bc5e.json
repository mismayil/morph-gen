This word would mean \"loan apartment\" or \"apartment financed by a loan\".\n\n**Step 4:**  Let's verify the usage of the affixes:\n    * \"a\" is used as a suffix to the root \"noesa\".\n    * \"asunto\" is used as a separate word, combined with the modified root \"noesa\".\n\n**Final Answer:** <Answer>noesaasunto</Answer>",

Finnish word formation often follows a pattern of suffixes (affixes added to the end of the word).\n\n**Step 2:**  Let's try adding \"ko\" to the end of the root: \"nancko\". This doesn't seem to make a grammatically correct Finnish word.\n\n**Step 3:**  Let's try adding \"han\" to the end of the root: \"nancohan\". This also doesn't seem to make a grammatically correct Finnish word.\n\n**Step 4:**  Since adding the affixes individually doesn't work, let's try combining them.  We can add \"han\" to the end of the root, and then add \"ko\" to the end of that: \"nancohan**ko**\".

We need to figure out where each affix goes.\n3. **Word Formation:**  Combine the root and affixes according to Finnish grammar.\n\n**Example 1:  Let's apply this to the example you provided.**\n\n* **Word root:** atalel (meaning \"ajatel\" in Finnish, which means \"to think\")\n* **Affixes:** a, tu\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n* **Root:** \"atalel\" is a verb root.\n* **Affixes:** \n    * \"a\" is a common prefix in Finnish, often used to create verbs.\n    * \"tu\" is a suffix that can indicate the past tense.\n\n**Word Formation:**\n\n* Since \"a\" is a prefix, it goes before the root: \"atalel\" -> \"aatatel\"\n* \"tu\" is a suffix, so it goes after the root: \"aatatel\" -> \"aatateltu\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<Answer>aatateltu</Answer>\n\n**Affixes Used:**\n\n* a (prefix)\n* tu (suffix)",

These suffixes can modify the meaning and grammatical function of the word.\n\n**Example 1:  vantu, ko, is, han**\n\n1. **Identify the root:**  \"vantu\" means \"johtu\" (to be caused by) in Finnish.\n2. **Analyze the affixes:**\n    * **ko:**  This is a question marker, often used to form yes/no questions.\n    * **is:** This is a possessive suffix, indicating possession.\n    * **han:** This is a third-person singular pronoun, often used as a subject.\n3. **Construct the word:**  Since \"han\" is a subject pronoun, it should come first.  \"ko\" is a question marker, so it should be at the end.  \"is\" is a possessive suffix, so it should be attached to the root.\n4. **Final word:**  \"han vantu is ko\"\n\n**Answer:** <Answer>han vantu is ko</Answer> \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **han:**  Third-person singular pronoun (subject)\n* **vantu:**  Root word meaning \"johtu\" (to be caused by)\n* **is:**  Possessive suffix\n* **ko:**  Question marker",

Finnish word formation often follows a specific order.  Let's consider the common patterns:\n\n* **-sta:** This is a common suffix indicating \"from\" or \"out of\". It often comes at the end of a word.\n* **-i:** This is a common suffix indicating the nominative singular case. It can come before or after other suffixes.\n* **-an:** This is a common suffix indicating the partitive case. It can come before or after other suffixes.\n\n**Step 2:**  Let's try combining the affixes based on their typical positions:\n\n* **väntärohd + sta + i + an:** This order seems plausible, as it places the \"-sta\" at the end and allows for the \"-i\" and \"-an\" to be in either order.\n\n**Step 3:**  Let's check if this combination makes sense in Finnish grammar:\n\n* **väntärohdsta:** This is a valid word in Finnish, meaning \"from the starting point\".\n* **väntärohdsta + i:** This is also a valid word, meaning \"the starting point from\".\n* **väntärohdsta + i + an:** This is a valid word, meaning \"some of the starting point from\".\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<Answer>väntärohdstaian</Answer>\n\n**Affixes used:**\n\n* **-sta:**  Indicates \"from\" or \"out of\"\n* **-i:**  Indicates the nominative singular case\n* **-an:**  Indicates the partitive case",

These suffixes can modify the meaning and grammatical function of the word.\n\n**Applying the Rules**\n\n1. **Identify the root:** The root is \"naeka,\" meaning \"paina\" (to press) in Finnish.\n2. **Analyze the affixes:** We have three affixes: \"ko,\" \"han,\" and \"a.\"\n3. **Determine the order:**  Finnish word formation often follows a specific order for suffixes.  We need to figure out the correct order for \"ko,\" \"han,\" and \"a.\"\n4. **Construct the word:**  Based on the order, we'll append the affixes to the root.\n\n**The Challenge**\n\nWithout more information about the specific grammatical functions of the affixes \"ko,\" \"han,\" and \"a,\" it's impossible to determine the correct order and construct a grammatically correct Finnish word. \n\n**Need More Information**\n\nTo provide a valid answer, we need additional information about the affixes:\n\n* **Grammatical function:** What do each of the affixes \"ko,\" \"han,\" and \"a\" indicate? Are they case markers, plural markers, or something else?\n* **Order of application:** Is there a specific order in which these affixes should be applied?\n\n**Example 2 (Illustrative)**\n\nLet's assume we have the following information:\n\n* **ko:**  Plural marker\n* **han:**  Nominative case marker\n* **a:**  Third-person singular possessive marker\n\nIn this case, the word would be constructed as follows:\n\n1. **Root:** naeka\n2. **Plural:** naeka + ko = naekako\n3. **Nominative:** naekako + han = naekakohan\n4. **Possessive:** naekakohan + a = naekakohana\n\n**<Answer>naekakohana</Answer>** \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPlease provide the grammatical functions and potential order of the affixes \"ko,\" \"han,\" and \"a\" to enable the construction of a grammatically correct Finnish word.",

Finnish word formation often follows a specific order, but without more context, we can't be sure. Let's try a few combinations.\n\n**Possible Combinations:**\n\n* **tojan:** This adds the suffix \"-n\" to the root. It's possible, but we need to see if the other affixes fit.\n* **tojai:** This adds the suffix \"-i\" to the root. Again, we need to see if the other affixes fit.\n* **tojap:** This adds the suffix \"-p\" to the root.  This is unlikely as \"-p\" is not a common Finnish suffix.\n\n**Step 2:** Let's try adding the remaining affixes to the existing possibilities:\n\n* **tojanpas:** This adds \"-pas\" to \"tojan\". This is a possible word formation, but we need to check if it makes sense in Finnish.\n* **tojaipas:** This adds \"-pas\" to \"tojai\". This is also a possible word formation, but we need to check if it makes sense in Finnish.\n\n**Step 3:**  We need to consider the meaning of the word.  Without more context, it's impossible to know if either \"tojanpas\" or \"tojaipas\" is a valid Finnish word.\n\n**Answer:**  We need more information to determine the correct word.

The order of these suffixes is crucial for grammatical correctness.\n\n**Steps to Constructing a Word**\n\n1. **Identify the Root:** The root is the core meaning of the word. In this case, it's \"ninsiä\" meaning \"selviä\" (clear, obvious).\n\n2. **Determine Affix Order:**  Finnish grammar has specific rules for affix order.  We need to figure out the correct sequence for \"kö\", \"hän\", and \"vät\".\n\n3. **Apply Affixes:**  We'll add the affixes one by one, following the established order.\n\n**Example 1:  Word Root: ninsiä, Definition: selviä, Affixes: kö, hän, vät**\n\n1. **Root:** ninsiä\n2. **Affix Order:**  In Finnish, \"kö\" is a question marker and usually comes last. \"hän\" is a third-person singular pronoun and often precedes \"vät\".  So the order is likely \"hän\", \"vät\", \"kö\".\n3. **Applying Affixes:**\n    * **ninsiä + hän = ninsiähän** (meaning \"he/she is clear\")\n    * **ninsiähän + vät = ninsiähänvät** (meaning \"they are clear\")\n    * **ninsiähänvät + kö = ninsiähänvätkö** (meaning \"are they clear?\")\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<Answer>ninsiähänvätkö</Answer> \n\n**Affixes Used:**\n\n* **hän:** third-person singular pronoun\n* **vät:** third-person plural suffix\n* **kö:** question marker",

We need to figure out the correct sequence for the provided affixes: \"han,\" \"ne,\" \"e,\" and \"ko.\"\n\n3. **Apply Suffixes:**  Once we know the order, we add the suffixes one by one to the root.\n\n**Example 1:  Missing Information**\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing the specific grammatical functions of the affixes \"han,\" \"ne,\" \"e,\" and \"ko,\" we cannot construct a grammatically correct Finnish word.  We need more information about these affixes to determine their order and how they modify the root \"madnu.\"\n\n**To Complete the Task:**\n\nPlease provide the following information:\n\n* **Definitions of the affixes:** What grammatical function does each affix serve (e.g., plural, possessive, past tense)?\n* **Suffix Order Rules:** Are there any specific rules about the order in which these affixes can be used?\n\nOnce you provide this information, I can help you construct a grammatically correct Finnish word.",

The order of suffixes is crucial for grammatical correctness.  \n\n**Steps to Constructing a Word**\n\n1. **Identify the Root:** The root is the core meaning of the word. In this case, it's \"määs\" meaning \"pääs\" (head in Finnish).\n\n2. **Determine Suffix Order:**  Finnish grammar has specific rules for suffix order.  We need to figure out the correct sequence for the provided affixes: \"kö\", \"isi\", \"n\", \"hän\".\n\n3. **Apply Suffixes:**  We'll add the suffixes one by one, following the established order.\n\n**Example 1: (Missing Information)**\n\nYou haven't provided the affixes for Example 1. Please provide the list of affixes so I can help you construct the word. \n\n**Example 2: (Let's assume some affixes)**\n\nLet's say the affixes for Example 1 are: \"kö\", \"isi\", \"n\", \"hän\".\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Root:** määs\n2. **Suffix Order:**  In Finnish, the order would likely be: \"n\", \"isi\", \"kö\", \"hän\" (based on common suffix order).\n3. **Word Formation:** \n    * määs + n = määsn\n    * määsn + isi = määsnisi\n    * määsnisi + kö = määsnisi kö\n    * määsnisi kö + hän = määsnisi köhän\n\n**Answer:** <Answer>määsnisi köhän</Answer>\n\n**Verification:**\n\n* **Affixes Used:** n, isi, kö, hän (all used once)\n* **No Extra Affixes:**  Only the provided affixes are used.\n\n**Important Note:**  Without knowing the specific grammatical function of each affix, it's difficult to guarantee the word's meaning or complete grammatical accuracy.

Finnish is an agglutinative language, meaning that suffixes are added to the end of words to create new meanings.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the word**\n\nBased on the analysis of the affixes and the typical word order in Finnish, a possible word formation is:\n\n* **hajan** (meaning \"the sa\") + **ko** (meaning \"is it?\") + **i** (meaning \"the\") + **han** (meaning \"he/she/it\")\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n<Answer>hajankoihan</Answer>",

The order of these suffixes is crucial for grammatical correctness.\n\n**Steps to Construct the Word**\n\n1. **Identify the Base Form:** The base form of the word is usually the root itself. In this case, the base form is \"tulkimm.\"\n\n2. **Determine the Order of Affixes:**  Finnish grammar dictates a specific order for suffixes.  We need to figure out the correct sequence for \"an,\" \"lla,\" \"kin,\" and \"i.\"\n\n3. **Apply the Affixes:**  Once we know the order, we add the suffixes one by one to the base form.\n\n**Example 1:  tulkimm (vanhimm) + an, lla, kin, i**\n\n1. **Base Form:** tulkimm\n2. **Affix Order:**  The most common order for these affixes would be:\n    * **i:**  This is a common suffix for forming adjectives.\n    * **lla:**  This is a locative case ending (indicating location).\n    * **kin:**  This is an emphatic particle.\n    * **an:**  This is a possessive suffix (indicating possession).\n3. **Word Formation:**\n    * tulkimm + i = tulkimmi\n    * tulkimmi + lla = tulkimmilla\n    * tulkimmilla + kin = tulkimmillakin\n    * tulkimmillakin + an = tulkimmillakinan\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<Answer>tulkimmillakinan</Answer>\n\n**Affixes Used:**\n\n* i\n* lla\n* kin\n* an",

So, we get \"nuvali\" (meaning \"low\").\n* **-lla:** This suffix indicates \"with\" or \"by means of\".  We get \"nuvalilla\" (meaning \"with the low one\").\n* **-kin:** This suffix adds emphasis.  We get \"nuvalillakin\" (meaning \"even with the low one\").\n* **-an:** This suffix indicates \"from\" or \"out of\".  We get \"nuvalillakinan\" (meaning \"from even with the low one\").\n* **-imm:** This suffix indicates the superlative degree.

The order of these suffixes is crucial for grammatical correctness.  \n\n**Steps to Constructing a Word**\n\n1. **Identify the Root:** The root is the core meaning of the word. In this case, it's \"gui\" meaning \"voi\" (butter).\n\n2. **Determine the Affix Order:**  Finnish grammar has specific rules for affix order.  We need to figure out the correct sequence for the provided affixes: \"ta,\" \"in,\" \"ko,\" \"isi,\" \"han.\"\n\n3. **Apply the Affixes:**  We'll add the affixes one by one, following the established order, to create a grammatically correct Finnish word.\n\n**Example 1: (Missing Information)**\n\nYou haven't provided the affixes for Example 1. Please provide the list of affixes so I can help you construct the word. \n\n**Example 2: (Let's assume some affixes)**\n\nLet's say the affixes for Example 1 are: \"ta,\" \"in,\" \"ko,\" \"isi,\" \"han.\"\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Root:** gui (voi)\n2. **Affix Order:**  Finnish grammar doesn't have a strict order for these affixes. We can arrange them in any order.\n3. **Word Formation:**  Let's use the order: \"gui\" + \"isi\" + \"han\" + \"ko\" + \"in\" + \"ta\" \n4. **Final Word:** guisishankota\n\n**Answer:** <Answer>guisishankota</Answer>\n\n**Affixes Used:**\n\n* **isi:**  This is a common suffix in Finnish, often used to form adjectives.\n* **han:** This is a suffix that can indicate a person or thing.\n* **ko:** This is a suffix that can indicate a question.\n* **in:** This is a suffix that can indicate a location.\n* **ta:** This is a suffix that can indicate a state or condition.",
