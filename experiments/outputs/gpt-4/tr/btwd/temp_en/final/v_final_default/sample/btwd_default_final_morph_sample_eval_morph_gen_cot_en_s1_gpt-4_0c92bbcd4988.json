            "model_output": "The suffixes given are \"di\" and \"siz\". In Turkish, the suffix \"di\" is a past tense marker and should be attached to a verb root, but \"tarif\" is a noun meaning \"recipe\" or \"description\". The suffix \"siz\" is a negation suffix that can be attached to nouns or adjectives to mean \"without\" or \"lacking\". To form a grammatically correct word, we should first attach \"siz\" to the noun root \"tarif\" to create an adjective meaning \"without a recipe\" or \"undescribed\". Then, since \"di\" cannot be directly attached to a noun, we cannot use it in this construction. Therefore, we cannot form a grammatically correct word using both suffixes with the given root \"tarif\".\n\nHowever, if we consider \"tarif\" as a verb root (which is not standard for Turkish but for the sake of the exercise), we could form a past tense verb and then negate it. But this would not be standard Turkish and would not make sense as \"tarif\" is not used as a verb. Therefore, there is no correct answer to this example as given. If we were to ignore the grammatical correctness, we could forcibly create the word \"tarifsizdi\" but this would not be a proper or meaningful word in Turkish.",

Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given suffixes to the root. Use each suffix exactly once. After forming a word, list each suffix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no suffix is used more than once, confirm that all provided suffixes are used, verify that no extra suffixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and present the correctly formed word enclosed in angle brackets. Example: <correctword>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: karşı\nSuffixes: da, m, ydı\nAnswer: The suffixes given are \"da\", \"m\", and \"ydı\". By appending the suffixes in the correct order to the word root \"karşı\", we can get the word \"karşımdaydı\" which is grammatically correct and roughly translates to \"it was in front of me\" in English. The provided suffixes are used only once. No extra suffixes are included. The word complies with all the rules. <karşımdaydı>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: güzel\nSuffixes: in, liğ, in\nAnswer:",

By appending the suffixes in the correct order to the word root \"böyle\", we can get the word \"böyleneleri\" which is grammatically incorrect in Turkish. The correct order of suffixes to form a meaningful word in Turkish would be \"ler\" to make it plural, \"i\" for the accusative case, and \"ne\" does not directly attach to \"böyle\" to form a standard word. However, if we consider \"ne\" as a question particle, it would not be attached to the word but rather used separately. Therefore, a grammatically correct construction is not possible with the given suffixes directly attached to the root \"böyle\". If we were to use \"ne\" as a separate word, we could form the phrase \"böyleleri ne?\" which would mean \"What about these?\" in English.

Therefore, we need to correct this.\n\nThe correct construction is \"olamadıktan sonra\" using the suffixes \"a\", \"ma\", \"dık\", \"tan\", but we still need to use \"uş\" and \"tur\". The suffix \"uş\" is a nominalization suffix that cannot be used in this context, and \"tur\" is a suffix that denotes certainty or a general fact, which also cannot be used in this context. Therefore, it seems there is a mistake, as these suffixes cannot be used together with the others to form a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\nHowever, if we consider \"ol\" as a root that can take on different meanings, we might be able to use \"uş\" as a nominalization suffix to create a noun, and then \"tur\" to indicate a general fact about that noun. For example, \"ol\" can also mean \"happen\" or \"occur,\" and \"uş\" can turn it into a noun meaning \"the happening\" or \"the occurrence.\" Then \"tur\" can be added to indicate that it is a general fact. But this would not be a single word and would not use all the suffixes in a grammatically correct manner.\n\nGiven the constraints and the suffixes provided, it is not possible to form a grammatically correct word using all the suffixes exactly once without adding or omitting any.

Think step by step and present the correctly formed word enclosed in angle brackets. Example: <correctword>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: ol\nSuffixes: a, dık, ma, ım, lar, sa\nAnswer: The suffix given are \"a\", \"dık\", \"ma\", \"ım\", \"lar\", and \"sa\". By appending the suffixes in the correct order to the word root \"ol\", we get the word \"olamadıklarımsa\" which is grammatically correct and roughly translates to \"and the ones that I couldn't become\" in English.

The word complies with all the rules. <olamadıklarımsa>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: ol\nSuffixes: ma, ımız, ı, lar, a, dık\nAnswer:",
