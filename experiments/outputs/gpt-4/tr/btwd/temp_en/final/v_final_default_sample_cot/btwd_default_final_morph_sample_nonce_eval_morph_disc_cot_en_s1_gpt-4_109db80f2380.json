However, this combination is not typically used in Turkish grammar in this form.

The \"in\" suffix is likely intended to be the plural possessive suffix \"-in\" (for example, \"kitapların\" means \"of the books\"), but it is not correctly applied here. The order of the suffixes and the use of \"n\" as a standalone suffix are incorrect. The correct order should be \"risevli\" (with duty), followed by \"si\" (its), and then \"in\" (plural possessive), if applicable. The derived word \"risevnlisiin\" does not adhere to Turkish grammar rules. <No>",

Think step by step and answer with Yes or No, placing your response within angle brackets. Example: <Yes> or <No>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: ökişde\nDefinition: ökişde means ilerle in Turkish.\nSuffixes: in, me, ler, e, t\nDerived word: ökişdetmelerine\nAnswer: First, \"t\" then \"me\", \"ler\", \"in\" and \"e\" are applied to the root \"ökişde\" which is defined to mean \"ilerle\" in Turkish. According to Turkish grammar rules, this order of suffixes is allowed and the derived word \"ökişdetmelerine\" roughly translates to \"to their advancings\" in English. Hence, the derived word is grammatically correct. <Yes>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: şoyuka\nDefinition: şoyuka means yakala in Turkish.\nSuffixes: na, ma, sı, ya, ma\nDerived word: şoyukamamayasına\nAnswer:",

The order of suffixes does not adhere to Turkish grammar rules. Specifically, the possessive suffix \"sı\" should come before the dative case suffix \"ya\", and it is not grammatically correct to have two dative case suffixes (\"ya\" and \"na\") in sequence. Additionally, the double negation with \"ma\" is not standard in noun formation. Therefore, the derived word \"şoyukamamayasına\" is not grammatically correct. <No>",

Think step by step and answer with Yes or No, placing your response within angle brackets. Example: <Yes> or <No>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: içüm\nDefinition: içüm means ölüm in Turkish.\nSuffixes: me, süz, leş, il, si, tir\nDerived word: içümsüzleştirilmesi\nAnswer: First, \"süz\" then \"leş\", \"tir\", \"il\", \"me\" and \"si\" are applied to the root \"içüm\" which is defined to mean \"ölüm\" in Turkish. According to Turkish grammar rules, this order of suffixes is allowed and the derived word \"içümsüzleştirilmesi\" roughly translates to \"its immortalization\" in English. Hence, the derived word is grammatically correct. <Yes>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: dımın\nDefinition: dımın means yakın in Turkish.\nSuffixes: diğ, abil, tır, i, in, laş\nDerived word: dımınilaştırabildiğin\nAnswer:",

The given derived word \"ugıklayamaıdığım\" is incorrect because it uses \"ya\" instead of \"bil\" for potential mood, and the order of \"ma\" and \"dığ\" is reversed. Therefore, the derived word is not grammatically correct. <No>",

Think step by step and answer with Yes or No, placing your response within angle brackets. Example: <Yes> or <No>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: içüm\nDefinition: içüm means ölüm in Turkish.\nSuffixes: me, süz, leş, il, si, tir\nDerived word: içümsüzleştirilmesi\nAnswer: First, \"süz\" then \"leş\", \"tir\", \"il\", \"me\" and \"si\" are applied to the root \"içüm\" which is defined to mean \"ölüm\" in Turkish. According to Turkish grammar rules, this order of suffixes is allowed and the derived word \"içümsüzleştirilmesi\" roughly translates to \"its immortalization\" in English. Hence, the derived word is grammatically correct. <Yes>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: ügrek\nDefinition: ügrek means örnek in Turkish.\nSuffixes: ebil, in, dir, il, ir, len\nDerived word: ügreklenirilebilindir\nAnswer:",

The correct order should be \"sız\", \"lık\", \"lar\", \"ınız\" but in the derived word, \"a\" is placed before \"sız\" which is not correct.

The derived word \"maroluşturıduklarnı\" is incorrect because it uses the wrong possessive suffix. The correct form should be \"maroluşturduklarını\". Hence, the derived word is not grammatically correct. <No>",

Next, \"eceğ\" is added, but this is where the problem arises. The suffix \"eceğ\" does not exist in Turkish. The correct future tense suffix would be \"eceğiz\" for \"we will\" but it should be attached after \"ebil\" and before the personal suffix \"iniz\" which stands for \"you\" in the plural form. The correct order should be \"root + leş + tir + ebil + eceğiz + iniz\". Therefore, the derived word \"iyvinleştirebilieceğiniz\" is not grammatically correct due to the incorrect suffix \"eceğ\" and its placement. The answer is <No>.",

Think step by step and answer with Yes or No, placing your response within angle brackets. Example: <Yes> or <No>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: ıgram\nDefinition: ıgram means anlam in Turkish.\nSuffixes: ıl, sız, tır, laş, ı, nın, dığ\nDerived word: ıgramsızlaştırıldığının\nAnswer: First, \"sız\" then \"laş\", \"tır\", \"ıl\", \"dığ\", \"ı\" and \"nın\" are applied to the root \"ıgram\" which is defined to mean \"anlam\" in Turkish. According to Turkish grammar rules, this order of suffixes is allowed and the derived word \"ıgramsızlaştırıldığının\" roughly translates to \"of that it has been rendered meaningless\" in English. Hence, the derived word is grammatically correct. <Yes>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: malış\nDefinition: malış means sıkış in Turkish.\nSuffixes: nı, yacağ, tır, ma, a, ıl, ı\nDerived word: malıştırılmayacağaını\nAnswer:",

After that, \"a\" is added for the dative case, and finally \"ı\" and \"nı\" are added for the possessive and accusative cases, respectively. However, the order of the last two suffixes is incorrect. In Turkish, the possessive suffix (\"ı\") should come before the case suffix (\"a\"), and the accusative suffix (\"nı\") should be at the end. The correct form should be \"malıştırılmayacağının\" to mean \"that it will not be squeezed.\" Therefore, the derived word \"malıştırılmayacağaını\" is not grammatically correct. <No>",

Think step by step and answer with Yes or No, placing your response within angle brackets. Example: <Yes> or <No>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: ıgram\nDefinition: ıgram means anlam in Turkish.\nSuffixes: ıl, sız, tır, laş, ı, nın, dığ\nDerived word: ıgramsızlaştırıldığının\nAnswer: First, \"sız\" then \"laş\", \"tır\", \"ıl\", \"dığ\", \"ı\" and \"nın\" are applied to the root \"ıgram\" which is defined to mean \"anlam\" in Turkish. According to Turkish grammar rules, this order of suffixes is allowed and the derived word \"ıgramsızlaştırıldığının\" roughly translates to \"of that it has been rendered meaningless\" in English. Hence, the derived word is grammatically correct. <Yes>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: siznek\nDefinition: siznek means gerçek in Turkish.\nSuffixes: m, leş, dur, e, tir, um, iyor\nDerived word: siznekleştiremiyorumdur\nAnswer:",

The correct order should be \"im\" first to denote \"my\" and then \"iz\" to denote \"our\". Therefore, the derived word \"lilcekleştiremediğizim\" is not grammatically correct.\n\nAnswer: <No>",

The suffix \"im\" is then applied to indicate the first person singular possession, forming \"lilcekleştirmediğim\" which means \"that I do not make real\". The correct order of suffixes should be \"e\" to indicate the dative case, but instead, \"iz\" is applied which is the plural possessive marker for \"we\". However, \"iz\" cannot be directly applied after \"im\" because \"im\" indicates first person singular, and \"iz\" indicates first person plural.

The correct form should be \"lilcekleştirmediğime\" if it were to end with the first person singular dative case, or \"lilcekleştirmediğimiz\" if it were to be first person plural possessive. <No>",

            "prompt": "You are given a novel word root with its definition, a list of suffixes (separated by comma) and a word in Turkish that is derived from the given word root using the given suffixes. Your task is to determine whether the derived word is grammatically correct. First, analyze how the suffixes interact with the word root. Then, assess the order in which the suffixes are applied and verify that this order adheres to the language's rules. Think step by step and answer with Yes or No, placing your response within angle brackets. Example: <Yes> or <No>\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: ıgram\nDefinition: ıgram means anlam in Turkish.\nSuffixes: ıl, sız, tır, laş, ı, nın, dığ\nDerived word: ıgramsızlaştırıldığının\nAnswer: First, \"sız\" then \"laş\", \"tır\", \"ıl\", \"dığ\", \"ı\" and \"nın\" are applied to the root \"ıgram\" which is defined to mean \"anlam\" in Turkish. According to Turkish grammar rules, this order of suffixes is allowed and the derived word \"ıgramsızlaştırıldığının\" roughly translates to \"of that it has been rendered meaningless\" in English. Hence, the derived word is grammatically correct. <Yes>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: şıka\nDefinition: şıka means yaşa in Turkish.\nSuffixes: yacağ, a, ma, t, ız, ım, a\nDerived word: şıkaaamayacağımızt\nAnswer:",

            "model_output": "First, the suffix \"ma\" is applied to negate the root \"şıka\", which means \"yaşa\" in Turkish. Then, \"yacağ\" is added to form the future tense, followed by \"ımız\" to denote first person plural possession. The suffix \"t\" is added at the end to form the accusative case. However, there is an error in the order and repetition of the suffix \"a\". The correct order should be \"şıka\" + \"ma\" + \"yacağ\" + \"ımız\" + \"t\", but in the derived word, there are additional \"a\"s and the placement of \"t\" is incorrect. Therefore, the derived word \"şıkaaamayacağımızt\" is not grammatically correct. <No>",
