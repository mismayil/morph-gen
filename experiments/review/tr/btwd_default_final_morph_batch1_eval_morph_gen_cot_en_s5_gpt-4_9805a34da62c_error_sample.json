In Turkish, to convert an adjective to a verb, you often use the affix \"-(I)r\" or \"-(I)l\" (with vowel harmony). However, since we don't have such an affix in the list, we can assume that \"kuru\" is being used as a verb root here, meaning \"to dry\". So we can directly add \"t\" to indicate past tense: \"kurut\" (he/she/it dried).\n\n2. \"muş\" is a suffix that is used to indicate hearsay or uncertainty about the past. It should be attached after the verb root has been put into the past tense: \"kurutmuş\" (he/she/it has apparently dried).\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<kuru> + <t> + <muş> = <kurutmuş>\n\nLet's verify adherence to the rules:\n- No affix is used more than once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes outside the provided list are included.\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>kurutmuş</Answer>\n\nList of affixes used:\n- t\n- muş\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: kitap\nAffixes: da, çı\nAnswer: First, let's append the affixes to the root \"kitap\" one by one, following Turkish grammar rules.\n\n1. \"kitap\" + \"çı\" = \"kitapçı\" (meaning \"bookshop\" or \"bookseller\")\n2. \"kitapçı\" + \"da\" = \"kitapçıda\" (meaning \"in the bookshop\")\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"çı\" (suffix that turns a noun into a person or place associated with that noun)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix, meaning \"in\" or \"at\")\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<Answer>kitapçıda</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: parça\nAffixes: mış, lan\nAnswer: First, we will append the affix \"lan\" to the root \"parça\" to create a verb form that means \"to become fragmented\" or \"to be divided into pieces\". Then, we will add the affix \"mış\" to indicate past tense, third person singular in the indicative mood, which also implies an evidential or hearsay past.\n\nStep 1: parça + lan = parçalan (to become fragmented)\nStep 2: parçalan + mış = parçalanmış (has/had become fragmented, it is said to have become fragmented)\n\n<Answer>parçalanmış</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. lan\n2. mış\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: sorun\nAffixes: lar, ım\nAnswer: First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"sorun\" in a grammatically correct order. In Turkish, the plural affix \"lar\" is added to a noun to make it plural, and the possessive affix \"ım\" is added to indicate possession (in this case, first person singular - \"my\").\n\nStep 1: Add the plural affix \"lar\" to the root \"sorun\" to make it plural.\nResult: sorunlar\n\nStep 2: Add the possessive affix \"ım\" to the pluralized noun to indicate possession.\nResult: sorunlarım\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n1. lar (plural)\n2. ım (first person singular possessive)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<Answer>sorunlarım</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: nitele\nAffixes: miş, n\nAnswer: First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"nitele\" in a grammatically correct way in Turkish.\n\n1. The affix \"n\" is a passive voice marker for verbs in Turkish and is used after the root of the verb before tense or mood markers. So, we add \"n\" to \"nitele\" to get \"nitelen\".\n\n2. The affix \"miş\" is a past tense marker that indicates hearsay or uncertainty about the action. It is used after the verb root or after other affixes that modify the verb. So, we add \"miş\" after \"nitelen\" to get \"nitelenmiş\".\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<nitele> + <n> + <miş> = <nitelenmiş>\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. n - passive voice marker\n2. miş - past tense hearsay marker\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<Answer>nitelenmiş</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: yalan\nAffixes: la, lar\nAnswer:",

Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given affixes to the root. Use each affix exactly once. After forming a word, list each affix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no affix is used more than once, confirm that all provided affixes are used, verify that no extra affixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: kuru\nAffixes: t, muş\nAnswer: First, let's append the affixes to the root \"kuru\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"t\" is a past tense marker for verbs, but \"kuru\" is an adjective meaning \"dry\". In Turkish, to convert an adjective to a verb, you often use the affix \"-(I)r\" or \"-(I)l\" (with vowel harmony). However, since we don't have such an affix in the list, we can assume that \"kuru\" is being used as a verb root here, meaning \"to dry\". So we can directly add \"t\" to indicate past tense: \"kurut\" (he/she/it dried).\n\n2. \"muş\" is a suffix that is used to indicate hearsay or uncertainty about the past. It should be attached after the verb root has been put into the past tense: \"kurutmuş\" (he/she/it has apparently dried).\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<kuru> + <t> + <muş> = <kurutmuş>\n\nLet's verify adherence to the rules:\n- No affix is used more than once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes outside the provided list are included.\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>kurutmuş</Answer>\n\nList of affixes used:\n- t\n- muş\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: kitap\nAffixes: da, çı\nAnswer: First, let's append the affixes to the root \"kitap\" one by one, following Turkish grammar rules.\n\n1. \"kitap\" + \"çı\" = \"kitapçı\" (meaning \"bookshop\" or \"bookseller\")\n2. \"kitapçı\" + \"da\" = \"kitapçıda\" (meaning \"in the bookshop\")\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"çı\" (suffix that turns a noun into a person or place associated with that noun)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix, meaning \"in\" or \"at\")\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<Answer>kitapçıda</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: parça\nAffixes: mış, lan\nAnswer: First, we will append the affix \"lan\" to the root \"parça\" to create a verb form that means \"to become fragmented\" or \"to be divided into pieces\". Then, we will add the affix \"mış\" to indicate past tense, third person singular in the indicative mood, which also implies an evidential or hearsay past.\n\nStep 1: parça + lan = parçalan (to become fragmented)\nStep 2: parçalan + mış = parçalanmış (has/had become fragmented, it is said to have become fragmented)\n\n<Answer>parçalanmış</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. lan\n2. mış\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: sorun\nAffixes: lar, ım\nAnswer: First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"sorun\" in a grammatically correct order. In Turkish, the plural affix \"lar\" is added to a noun to make it plural, and the possessive affix \"ım\" is added to indicate possession (in this case, first person singular - \"my\").\n\nStep 1: Add the plural affix \"lar\" to the root \"sorun\" to make it plural.\nResult: sorunlar\n\nStep 2: Add the possessive affix \"ım\" to the pluralized noun to indicate possession.\nResult: sorunlarım\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n1. lar (plural)\n2. ım (first person singular possessive)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<Answer>sorunlarım</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: nitele\nAffixes: miş, n\nAnswer: First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"nitele\" in a grammatically correct way in Turkish.\n\n1. The affix \"n\" is a passive voice marker for verbs in Turkish and is used after the root of the verb before tense or mood markers. So, we add \"n\" to \"nitele\" to get \"nitelen\".\n\n2. The affix \"miş\" is a past tense marker that indicates hearsay or uncertainty about the action. It is used after the verb root or after other affixes that modify the verb. So, we add \"miş\" after \"nitelen\" to get \"nitelenmiş\".\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<nitele> + <n> + <miş> = <nitelenmiş>\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. n - passive voice marker\n2. miş - past tense hearsay marker\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<Answer>nitelenmiş</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: aşık\nAffixes: sın, dır\nAnswer:",

The affix \"n\" is a passive voice marker for verbs in Turkish and is used after the root of the verb before tense or mood markers. So, we add \"n\" to \"nitele\" to get \"nitelen\".\n\n2. The affix \"miş\" is a past tense marker that indicates hearsay or uncertainty about the action. It is used after the verb root or after other affixes that modify the verb. So, we add \"miş\" after \"nitelen\" to get \"nitelenmiş\".\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<nitele> + <n> + <miş> = <nitelenmiş>\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. n - passive voice marker\n2. miş - past tense hearsay marker\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<Answer>nitelenmiş</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: zorunda\nAffixes: dır, sın\nAnswer:",

In Turkish, the plural affix \"lar\" is added to a noun to make it plural, and the possessive affix \"ım\" is added to indicate possession (in this case, first person singular - \"my\").\n\nStep 1: Add the plural affix \"lar\" to the root \"sorun\" to make it plural.\nResult: sorunlar\n\nStep 2: Add the possessive affix \"ım\" to the pluralized noun to indicate possession.\nResult: sorunlarım\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n1. lar (plural)\n2. ım (first person singular possessive)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<Answer>sorunlarım</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: nitele\nAffixes: miş, n\nAnswer: First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"nitele\" in a grammatically correct way in Turkish.\n\n1. The affix \"n\" is a passive voice marker for verbs in Turkish and is used after the root of the verb before tense or mood markers. So, we add \"n\" to \"nitele\" to get \"nitelen\".\n\n2. The affix \"miş\" is a past tense marker that indicates hearsay or uncertainty about the action. It is used after the verb root or after other affixes that modify the verb. So, we add \"miş\" after \"nitelen\" to get \"nitelenmiş\".\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<nitele> + <n> + <miş> = <nitelenmiş>\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. n - passive voice marker\n2. miş - past tense hearsay marker\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<Answer>nitelenmiş</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: üz\nAffixes: müz, üntü\nAnswer:",

It often denotes a state or quality. So, we add \"lık\" to \"zayıf\" to form \"zayıflık\" which means \"weakness\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix.

It should be attached to a noun to indicate possession. In this case, we add \"ı\" to \"zayıflıklar\" to form \"zayıflıkları\" which means \"his/her/its weaknesses\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"lık\" to form \"zayıflık\"\n- \"lar\" to form \"zayıflıklar\"\n- \"ı\" to form \"zayıflıkları\"\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.

The order of affixes is important in Turkish, as it can change the meaning of the word. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"luğ\" is a nominalizing suffix that can turn adjectives or nouns into abstract nouns.\n2. \"a\" is a dative case suffix, indicating direction towards something or someone.\n3. \"un\" is a possessive suffix for third person singular (his/her/its).\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. Start with the root \"uzun\" (which means \"long\").\n2. Add the suffix \"luğ\" to create \"uzunluk\" (meaning \"length\").\n3. Add the suffix \"a\" to form \"uzunluğa\" (meaning \"to the length\").\n4. Finally, add the suffix \"un\" to get \"uzunluğuna\" (meaning \"to his/her/its length\").\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included. The final word is \"uzunluğuna\".\n\n<Answer>uzunluğuna</Answer>\n\nList of affixes used in order:\n- luğ\n- a\n- un\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: yakın\nAffixes: laş, tık, ça\nAnswer: First, let's append the affixes to the root \"yakın\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. yakın + laş = yakınlaş (to become close)\n2. yakınlaş + tık = yakınlaştık (we became close)\n3. yakınlaştık + ça = yakınlaştıkça (as we become close)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. laş\n2. tık\n3. ça\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes outside the provided list. The final word is \"yakınlaştıkça\".\n\n<Answer>yakınlaştıkça</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: büyü\nAffixes: çesine, miş, len\nAnswer: First, let's append the affixes to the root \"büyü\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"len\" is a passive or reflexive suffix that can be added directly to the root to make it an adjective or to give a meaning that the action is done to the subject itself. So we get \"büyülen\".\n\n2. \"miş\" is a suffix used to indicate hearsay or past experience that the speaker did not directly witness. It is often used after a verb, so we can add it to \"büyülen\" to create a verb in the past tense that implies hearsay. We get \"büyülenmiş\".\n\n3. \"çesine\" is a suffix that is used to indicate a manner or way of doing something, similar to the English \"-like\" or \"-as if\". It is added to the end of the word. So we add it to \"büyülenmiş\" to get \"büyülenmişçesine\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\nRoot: büyü\nAffixes: len, miş, çesine\nConstructed word: büyülenmişçesine\n\nTo verify adherence to the rules:\n- Each affix is used exactly once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes are included.\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>büyülenmişçesine</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and the root given:\n\nRoot: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\n\nIn Turkish, the affix \"me\" is a negation suffix for verbs, \"se\" is a conditional suffix, and \"k\" is a past tense suffix for verbs in the narrative (rarely used) or as a necessity mood marker.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be:\n1. \"me\" to negate the verb,\n2. \"se\" to turn it into a conditional mood,\n3. \"k\" to indicate past tense or necessity.\n\nSo, the constructed word would be \"farketmese\" (if it had not been noticed), but since we have the \"k\" affix, which doesn't fit well after \"se\" in this context, we might need to reconsider the order or the use of \"k\". The \"k\" suffix is not commonly used in modern Turkish and might be a typo or a mistake. If we ignore the \"k\" and just use \"me\" and \"se\", we get \"farketmese\" which is a grammatically correct word.\n\nHowever, if we are to use all affixes, the \"k\" would typically come before \"se\" to form a word that is grammatically correct but not commonly used in modern Turkish. The word would be \"farketmekse\" (if it is to be noticed/noticed), but this construction is highly unusual and not standard.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal of using all affixes once, the final answer would be:\n\n<Answer>farketmekse</Answer>\n\nAffixes used:\n1. me - negation\n2. k - past tense/necessity (though its use here is non-standard)\n3. se - conditional mood\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: dolu\nAffixes: u, nun, luğ\nAnswer:",

It often denotes a state or quality. So, we add \"luğ\" to \"dolu\" to form \"doluluk\" which means \"fullness\".\n2. \"nun\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular in the genitive case (indicating ownership). It should be attached to a noun to indicate possession. In this case, we add \"nun\" to \"doluluk\" to form \"doluluğun\" which means \"of the fullness\".\n3. \"u\" is a third person singular accusative case suffix. It should be attached to a noun to indicate a direct object. However, in this case, since \"doluluğun\" is already in the genitive case, adding an accusative case suffix does not make sense grammatically. \n\nIn Turkish, a word cannot be in the genitive case and accusative case at the same time. Therefore, we cannot use the \"u\" suffix after \"nun\". The correct grammatical construction would be to use \"u\" as a buffer letter for the \"luğ\" suffix when the last vowel of the root is \"u\" or \"ü\". So, the correct order of affixes would be:\n\n1. \"luğ\" to form \"doluluk\"\n2. \"u\" as a buffer letter for \"luğ\" (since \"dolu\" ends in \"u\")\n3. \"nun\" to form \"doluluğun\"\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"luğ\" to form \"doluluk\"\n- \"u\" as a buffer letter for \"luğ\"\n- \"nun\" to form \"doluluğun\"\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.

Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given affixes to the root. Use each affix exactly once. After forming a word, list each affix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no affix is used more than once, confirm that all provided affixes are used, verify that no extra affixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: zayıf\nAffixes: lık, ı, lar\nAnswer: First, let's append the affixes to the root \"zayıf\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"lık\" is a noun-forming suffix that can be used to create a noun from an adjective. It often denotes a state or quality. So, we add \"lık\" to \"zayıf\" to form \"zayıflık\" which means \"weakness\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix. When added to \"zayıflık\", it pluralizes the noun, resulting in \"zayıflıklar\" which means \"weaknesses\".\n3. \"ı\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular. It should be attached to a noun to indicate possession. In this case, we add \"ı\" to \"zayıflıklar\" to form \"zayıflıkları\" which means \"his/her/its weaknesses\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"lık\" to form \"zayıflık\"\n- \"lar\" to form \"zayıflıklar\"\n- \"ı\" to form \"zayıflıkları\"\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included. The final answer is:\n\n<Answer>zayıflıkları</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: uzun\nAffixes: luğ, a, un\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to append the affixes to the root \"uzun\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish morphology. The order of affixes is important in Turkish, as it can change the meaning of the word. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"luğ\" is a nominalizing suffix that can turn adjectives or nouns into abstract nouns.\n2. \"a\" is a dative case suffix, indicating direction towards something or someone.\n3. \"un\" is a possessive suffix for third person singular (his/her/its).\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. Start with the root \"uzun\" (which means \"long\").\n2. Add the suffix \"luğ\" to create \"uzunluk\" (meaning \"length\").\n3. Add the suffix \"a\" to form \"uzunluğa\" (meaning \"to the length\").\n4. Finally, add the suffix \"un\" to get \"uzunluğuna\" (meaning \"to his/her/its length\").\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included. The final word is \"uzunluğuna\".\n\n<Answer>uzunluğuna</Answer>\n\nList of affixes used in order:\n- luğ\n- a\n- un\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: yakın\nAffixes: laş, tık, ça\nAnswer: First, let's append the affixes to the root \"yakın\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. yakın + laş = yakınlaş (to become close)\n2. yakınlaş + tık = yakınlaştık (we became close)\n3. yakınlaştık + ça = yakınlaştıkça (as we become close)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. laş\n2. tık\n3. ça\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes outside the provided list. The final word is \"yakınlaştıkça\".\n\n<Answer>yakınlaştıkça</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: büyü\nAffixes: çesine, miş, len\nAnswer: First, let's append the affixes to the root \"büyü\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"len\" is a passive or reflexive suffix that can be added directly to the root to make it an adjective or to give a meaning that the action is done to the subject itself. So we get \"büyülen\".\n\n2. \"miş\" is a suffix used to indicate hearsay or past experience that the speaker did not directly witness. It is often used after a verb, so we can add it to \"büyülen\" to create a verb in the past tense that implies hearsay. We get \"büyülenmiş\".\n\n3. \"çesine\" is a suffix that is used to indicate a manner or way of doing something, similar to the English \"-like\" or \"-as if\". It is added to the end of the word. So we add it to \"büyülenmiş\" to get \"büyülenmişçesine\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\nRoot: büyü\nAffixes: len, miş, çesine\nConstructed word: büyülenmişçesine\n\nTo verify adherence to the rules:\n- Each affix is used exactly once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes are included.\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>büyülenmişçesine</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and the root given:\n\nRoot: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\n\nIn Turkish, the affix \"me\" is a negation suffix for verbs, \"se\" is a conditional suffix, and \"k\" is a past tense suffix for verbs in the narrative (rarely used) or as a necessity mood marker.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be:\n1. \"me\" to negate the verb,\n2. \"se\" to turn it into a conditional mood,\n3. \"k\" to indicate past tense or necessity.\n\nSo, the constructed word would be \"farketmese\" (if it had not been noticed), but since we have the \"k\" affix, which doesn't fit well after \"se\" in this context, we might need to reconsider the order or the use of \"k\". The \"k\" suffix is not commonly used in modern Turkish and might be a typo or a mistake. If we ignore the \"k\" and just use \"me\" and \"se\", we get \"farketmese\" which is a grammatically correct word.\n\nHowever, if we are to use all affixes, the \"k\" would typically come before \"se\" to form a word that is grammatically correct but not commonly used in modern Turkish. The word would be \"farketmekse\" (if it is to be noticed/noticed), but this construction is highly unusual and not standard.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal of using all affixes once, the final answer would be:\n\n<Answer>farketmekse</Answer>\n\nAffixes used:\n1. me - negation\n2. k - past tense/necessity (though its use here is non-standard)\n3. se - conditional mood\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: onlar\nAffixes: ymiş, ın, ki\nAnswer:",

When added to \"onların\", it specifies the noun, resulting in \"onlarınki\" which means \"the one(s) that belong to them\".\n\n3. \"ymış\" is a suffix used to indicate hearsay or past experience that the speaker did not directly witness. It is often used after a verb, but in this case, since \"onlar\" is a pronoun and not a verb, the suffix \"ymış\" does not grammatically fit. However, if we consider \"onlar\" as a noun meaning \"those\" (which is not standard), we could add \"ymış\" to create a non-standard form \"onlar(ı)ymış\" which would imply \"it turns out to be those\" or \"they were apparently\". This usage is highly unusual and not grammatically correct in standard Turkish.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal of using all affixes once, the final answer would be:\n\n<Answer>onlarınkiymış</Answer>\n\nAffixes used:\n1. ın - possessive suffix\n2. ki - relative adjective suffix\n3. ymış - hearsay suffix\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the use of \"ymış\" in this context is not standard Turkish and the word \"onlarınkiymış\" is not a commonly used or grammatically correct form.

So, we add \"lan\" to \"anlam\" to form \"anlamlan\" which is not a standard form. However, \"anlam\" is already a noun, and \"lan\" would typically be used with verbs. Therefore, we need to first turn \"anlam\" into a verb before we can use \"lan\". We do this by adding \"mak\", which is a suffix that turns a noun into an infinitive verb. So, \"anlam\" + \"mak\" = \"anlamak\" (to understand).\n\n2. Now that we have the verb \"anlamak\", we can add \"lan\" to form \"anlamaklan\", but this is not a correct form in Turkish. The correct form would be \"anlamak\" + \"lan\" = \"anlamalan\" (to be understood), but \"anlamalan\" is not a standard Turkish word. The correct usage of \"lan\" with \"anlam\" would be \"anlam\" + \"lan\" = \"anlamlandır\" (to make sense of), but we do not have the \"dır\" suffix in this case.

It often denotes a state or quality. So, we add \"lık\" to \"zayıf\" to form \"zayıflık\" which means \"weakness\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix. When added to \"zayıflık\", it pluralizes the noun, resulting in \"zayıflıklar\" which means \"weaknesses\".\n3. \"ı\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular. It should be attached to a noun to indicate possession. In this case, we add \"ı\" to \"zayıflıklar\" to form \"zayıflıkları\" which means \"his/her/its weaknesses\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"lık\" to form \"zayıflık\"\n- \"lar\" to form \"zayıflıklar\"\n- \"ı\" to form \"zayıflıkları\"\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.

The order of affixes is important in Turkish, as it can change the meaning of the word. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"luğ\" is a nominalizing suffix that can turn adjectives or nouns into abstract nouns.\n2. \"a\" is a dative case suffix, indicating direction towards something or someone.\n3. \"un\" is a possessive suffix for third person singular (his/her/its).\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. Start with the root \"uzun\" (which means \"long\").\n2. Add the suffix \"luğ\" to create \"uzunluk\" (meaning \"length\").\n3. Add the suffix \"a\" to form \"uzunluğa\" (meaning \"to the length\").\n4.

However, \"eleştiri\" is a noun, not a verb. To use \"iyor\", we need a verb form. The verb form of \"eleştiri\" is \"eleştir\" (to criticize).

Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given affixes to the root. Use each affix exactly once. After forming a word, list each affix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no affix is used more than once, confirm that all provided affixes are used, verify that no extra affixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: zayıf\nAffixes: lık, ı, lar\nAnswer: First, let's append the affixes to the root \"zayıf\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"lık\" is a noun-forming suffix that can be used to create a noun from an adjective. It often denotes a state or quality. So, we add \"lık\" to \"zayıf\" to form \"zayıflık\" which means \"weakness\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix. When added to \"zayıflık\", it pluralizes the noun, resulting in \"zayıflıklar\" which means \"weaknesses\".\n3. \"ı\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular. It should be attached to a noun to indicate possession. In this case, we add \"ı\" to \"zayıflıklar\" to form \"zayıflıkları\" which means \"his/her/its weaknesses\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"lık\" to form \"zayıflık\"\n- \"lar\" to form \"zayıflıklar\"\n- \"ı\" to form \"zayıflıkları\"\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included. The final answer is:\n\n<Answer>zayıflıkları</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: uzun\nAffixes: luğ, a, un\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to append the affixes to the root \"uzun\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish morphology. The order of affixes is important in Turkish, as it can change the meaning of the word. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"luğ\" is a nominalizing suffix that can turn adjectives or nouns into abstract nouns.\n2. \"a\" is a dative case suffix, indicating direction towards something or someone.\n3. \"un\" is a possessive suffix for third person singular (his/her/its).\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. Start with the root \"uzun\" (which means \"long\").\n2. Add the suffix \"luğ\" to create \"uzunluk\" (meaning \"length\").\n3. Add the suffix \"a\" to form \"uzunluğa\" (meaning \"to the length\").\n4. Finally, add the suffix \"un\" to get \"uzunluğuna\" (meaning \"to his/her/its length\").\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included. The final word is \"uzunluğuna\".\n\n<Answer>uzunluğuna</Answer>\n\nList of affixes used in order:\n- luğ\n- a\n- un\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: yakın\nAffixes: laş, tık, ça\nAnswer: First, let's append the affixes to the root \"yakın\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. yakın + laş = yakınlaş (to become close)\n2. yakınlaş + tık = yakınlaştık (we became close)\n3. yakınlaştık + ça = yakınlaştıkça (as we become close)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. laş\n2. tık\n3. ça\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes outside the provided list. The final word is \"yakınlaştıkça\".\n\n<Answer>yakınlaştıkça</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: büyü\nAffixes: çesine, miş, len\nAnswer: First, let's append the affixes to the root \"büyü\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"len\" is a passive or reflexive suffix that can be added directly to the root to make it an adjective or to give a meaning that the action is done to the subject itself. So we get \"büyülen\".\n\n2. \"miş\" is a suffix used to indicate hearsay or past experience that the speaker did not directly witness. It is often used after a verb, so we can add it to \"büyülen\" to create a verb in the past tense that implies hearsay. We get \"büyülenmiş\".\n\n3. \"çesine\" is a suffix that is used to indicate a manner or way of doing something, similar to the English \"-like\" or \"-as if\". It is added to the end of the word. So we add it to \"büyülenmiş\" to get \"büyülenmişçesine\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\nRoot: büyü\nAffixes: len, miş, çesine\nConstructed word: büyülenmişçesine\n\nTo verify adherence to the rules:\n- Each affix is used exactly once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes are included.\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>büyülenmişçesine</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and the root given:\n\nRoot: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\n\nIn Turkish, the affix \"me\" is a negation suffix for verbs, \"se\" is a conditional suffix, and \"k\" is a past tense suffix for verbs in the narrative (rarely used) or as a necessity mood marker.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be:\n1. \"me\" to negate the verb,\n2. \"se\" to turn it into a conditional mood,\n3. \"k\" to indicate past tense or necessity.\n\nSo, the constructed word would be \"farketmese\" (if it had not been noticed), but since we have the \"k\" affix, which doesn't fit well after \"se\" in this context, we might need to reconsider the order or the use of \"k\". The \"k\" suffix is not commonly used in modern Turkish and might be a typo or a mistake. If we ignore the \"k\" and just use \"me\" and \"se\", we get \"farketmese\" which is a grammatically correct word.\n\nHowever, if we are to use all affixes, the \"k\" would typically come before \"se\" to form a word that is grammatically correct but not commonly used in modern Turkish. The word would be \"farketmekse\" (if it is to be noticed/noticed), but this construction is highly unusual and not standard.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal of using all affixes once, the final answer would be:\n\n<Answer>farketmekse</Answer>\n\nAffixes used:\n1. me - negation\n2. k - past tense/necessity (though its use here is non-standard)\n3. se - conditional mood\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: sonra\nAffixes: nda, ki, sı\nAnswer:",

We will append the affixes to the root \"kovala\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"diğ\" is a relative suffix that turns a verb into an adjective or a noun.\n2. \"yabil\" is a potential mood suffix that indicates the ability to do the action of the verb.\n3. \"im\" is a possessive suffix for the first person singular.\n4. \"iz\" is a plural suffix for the first person.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be to first turn the verb into a potential mood, then make it into a noun with the relative suffix, and finally add the possessive and plural suffixes.\n\nSo, the construction would be as follows:\n- kovala (root) + yabil (potential mood) = kovalayabil\n- kovalayabil + diğ (relative suffix) = kovalayabildiğ\n- kovalayabildiğ + im (first person singular possessive) = kovalayabildiğim\n- kovalayabildiğim + iz (first person plural) = kovalayabildiğimiz\n\nThe final word is <Answer>kovalayabildiğimiz</Answer>.\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- yabil\n- diğ\n- im\n- iz\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: bebek\nAffixes: in, lik, ler, de\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions in Turkish:\n\n- \"in\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular (his/her/its).\n- \"lik\" is a suffix that can turn a noun into another noun, often indicating a state, condition, or quality.\n- \"ler\" is a plural suffix for nouns.\n- \"de\" is a locative suffix indicating the location (on, at, in).\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: bebek (baby)\n2. Add \"lik\" to form a noun that indicates a state or quality: bebeklik (childhood)\n3. Add \"ler\" to pluralize: bebeklikler (childhoods)\n4. Add \"in\" to indicate possession: bebekliklerin (of the childhoods)\n5. Add \"de\" to indicate location: bebekliklerinde (in the childhoods)\n\nThe final word is <Answer>bebekliklerinde</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- lik\n- ler\n- in\n- de\n\nAll provided affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: bulun\nAffixes: ma, ma, sı, na\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We have the root \"bulun\" and the affixes \"ma, ma, sı, na\". Since we have two \"ma\" affixes, we need to be careful about their placement and function in the word.\n\n1. The first \"ma\" is likely a negation suffix for verbs.\n2. The second \"ma\" could be a nominalization suffix, turning the verb into a noun.\n3. The \"sı\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular).\n4. The \"na\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nLet's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunma\" (not to be found)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its not being found)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its not being found)\n\nHowever, we still have one \"ma\" left, which is a nominalization suffix. We need to use it to turn the verb into a noun before we can add the possessive and dative suffixes:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (nominalization) = \"bulunma\" (the act of finding)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its finding)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its finding)\n4. \"bulunmasına\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunmamasına\" (to his/her/its not finding)\n\nNow we have used all the affixes correctly and constructed a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n<Answer>bulunmamasına</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. ma (nominalization)\n2. sı (possessive)\n3. na (dative)\n4. ma (negation)\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: şarkı\nAffixes: ki, lar, da, ın\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"şarkı\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"şarkı\" is the root word meaning \"song\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix.\n3. \"ın\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular \"his/her/its\").\n4. \"da\" is a locative suffix (meaning \"in/at\").\n5. \"ki\" is a suffix that is used to form an adjective from a noun phrase.\n\nThe correct order for the affixes would be:\n\n1. \"şarkı\" + \"lar\" = \"şarkılar\" (songs)\n2. \"şarkılar\" + \"ın\" = \"şarkıların\" (of the songs)\n3. \"şarkıların\" + \"da\" = \"şarkılarında\" (in their songs)\n4. \"şarkılarında\" + \"ki\" = \"şarkılarındaki\" (the ones in their songs)\n\nSo the final word is \"şarkılarındaki\".\n\n<Answer>şarkılarındaki</Answer>\n\nList of affixes used in order:\n1. lar\n2. ın\n3. da\n4. ki\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: kolay\nAffixes: laş, ma, tır, sa\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and the order in which they should be appended to the root \"kolay\" to form a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n1. \"laş\" - This is a derivational suffix that can be used to form an adjective or verb, often indicating becoming or getting to be in the state of the root.\n2. \"ma\" - This is a negation suffix that is often used to form the negative of verbs.\n3. \"tır\" - This is a causative suffix that can be used to form verbs that mean to make or cause to do something.\n4. \"sa\" - This is a conditional suffix that is used to form the conditional mood of verbs.\n\nThe correct order to append these affixes to the root \"kolay\" would be:\n\n1. kolay + laş = kolaylaş (to become easy)\n2. kolaylaş + tır = kolaylaştır (to make something become easy)\n3. kolaylaştır + ma = kolaylaştırma (to not make something become easy)\n4. kolaylaştırma + sa = kolaylaştırmasa (if [he/she/it] does not make something become easy)\n\nSo the final word is \"kolaylaştırmasa\".\n\n<Answer>kolaylaştırmasa</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. laş\n2. ma\n3. tır\n4. sa\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, no extra affixes are included, and the final word is grammatically correct in Turkish.\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: hedef\nAffixes: in, diğ, le, i\nAnswer:",

We will append the affixes to the root \"kovala\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"diğ\" is a relative suffix that turns a verb into an adjective or a noun.\n2. \"yabil\" is a potential mood suffix that indicates the ability to do the action of the verb.\n3. \"im\" is a possessive suffix for the first person singular.\n4. \"iz\" is a plural suffix for the first person.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be to first turn the verb into a potential mood, then make it into a noun with the relative suffix, and finally add the possessive and plural suffixes.\n\nSo, the construction would be as follows:\n- kovala (root) + yabil (potential mood) = kovalayabil\n- kovalayabil + diğ (relative suffix) = kovalayabildiğ\n- kovalayabildiğ + im (first person singular possessive) = kovalayabildiğim\n- kovalayabildiğim + iz (first person plural) = kovalayabildiğimiz\n\nThe final word is <Answer>kovalayabildiğimiz</Answer>.\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- yabil\n- diğ\n- im\n- iz\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: bebek\nAffixes: in, lik, ler, de\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions in Turkish:\n\n- \"in\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular (his/her/its).\n- \"lik\" is a suffix that can turn a noun into another noun, often indicating a state, condition, or quality.\n- \"ler\" is a plural suffix for nouns.\n- \"de\" is a locative suffix indicating the location (on, at, in).\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: bebek (baby)\n2. Add \"lik\" to form a noun that indicates a state or quality: bebeklik (childhood)\n3. Add \"ler\" to pluralize: bebeklikler (childhoods)\n4. Add \"in\" to indicate possession: bebekliklerin (of the childhoods)\n5.

We have the root \"bulun\" and the affixes \"ma, ma, sı, na\". Since we have two \"ma\" affixes, we need to be careful about their placement and function in the word.\n\n1. The first \"ma\" is likely a negation suffix for verbs.\n2. The second \"ma\" could be a nominalization suffix, turning the verb into a noun.\n3. The \"sı\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular).\n4.

Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: kovala\nAffixes: diğ, yabil, im, iz\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"kovala\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"diğ\" is a relative suffix that turns a verb into an adjective or a noun.\n2. \"yabil\" is a potential mood suffix that indicates the ability to do the action of the verb.\n3. \"im\" is a possessive suffix for the first person singular.\n4. \"iz\" is a plural suffix for the first person.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be to first turn the verb into a potential mood, then make it into a noun with the relative suffix, and finally add the possessive and plural suffixes.\n\nSo, the construction would be as follows:\n- kovala (root) + yabil (potential mood) = kovalayabil\n- kovalayabil + diğ (relative suffix) = kovalayabildiğ\n- kovalayabildiğ + im (first person singular possessive) = kovalayabildiğim\n- kovalayabildiğim + iz (first person plural) = kovalayabildiğimiz\n\nThe final word is <Answer>kovalayabildiğimiz</Answer>.\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- yabil\n- diğ\n- im\n- iz\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: bebek\nAffixes: in, lik, ler, de\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions in Turkish:\n\n- \"in\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular (his/her/its).\n- \"lik\" is a suffix that can turn a noun into another noun, often indicating a state, condition, or quality.\n- \"ler\" is a plural suffix for nouns.\n- \"de\" is a locative suffix indicating the location (on, at, in).\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: bebek (baby)\n2. Add \"lik\" to form a noun that indicates a state or quality: bebeklik (childhood)\n3. Add \"ler\" to pluralize: bebeklikler (childhoods)\n4. Add \"in\" to indicate possession: bebekliklerin (of the childhoods)\n5. Add \"de\" to indicate location: bebekliklerinde (in the childhoods)\n\nThe final word is <Answer>bebekliklerinde</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- lik\n- ler\n- in\n- de\n\nAll provided affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: bulun\nAffixes: ma, ma, sı, na\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We have the root \"bulun\" and the affixes \"ma, ma, sı, na\". Since we have two \"ma\" affixes, we need to be careful about their placement and function in the word.\n\n1. The first \"ma\" is likely a negation suffix for verbs.\n2. The second \"ma\" could be a nominalization suffix, turning the verb into a noun.\n3. The \"sı\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular).\n4. The \"na\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nLet's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunma\" (not to be found)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its not being found)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its not being found)\n\nHowever, we still have one \"ma\" left, which is a nominalization suffix. We need to use it to turn the verb into a noun before we can add the possessive and dative suffixes:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (nominalization) = \"bulunma\" (the act of finding)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its finding)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its finding)\n4. \"bulunmasına\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunmamasına\" (to his/her/its not finding)\n\nNow we have used all the affixes correctly and constructed a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n<Answer>bulunmamasına</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. ma (nominalization)\n2. sı (possessive)\n3. na (dative)\n4. ma (negation)\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: şarkı\nAffixes: ki, lar, da, ın\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"şarkı\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"şarkı\" is the root word meaning \"song\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix.\n3. \"ın\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular \"his/her/its\").\n4. \"da\" is a locative suffix (meaning \"in/at\").\n5. \"ki\" is a suffix that is used to form an adjective from a noun phrase.\n\nThe correct order for the affixes would be:\n\n1. \"şarkı\" + \"lar\" = \"şarkılar\" (songs)\n2. \"şarkılar\" + \"ın\" = \"şarkıların\" (of the songs)\n3. \"şarkıların\" + \"da\" = \"şarkılarında\" (in their songs)\n4. \"şarkılarında\" + \"ki\" = \"şarkılarındaki\" (the ones in their songs)\n\nSo the final word is \"şarkılarındaki\".\n\n<Answer>şarkılarındaki</Answer>\n\nList of affixes used in order:\n1. lar\n2. ın\n3. da\n4. ki\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: kolay\nAffixes: laş, ma, tır, sa\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and the order in which they should be appended to the root \"kolay\" to form a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n1. \"laş\" - This is a derivational suffix that can be used to form an adjective or verb, often indicating becoming or getting to be in the state of the root.\n2. \"ma\" - This is a negation suffix that is often used to form the negative of verbs.\n3. \"tır\" - This is a causative suffix that can be used to form verbs that mean to make or cause to do something.\n4. \"sa\" - This is a conditional suffix that is used to form the conditional mood of verbs.\n\nThe correct order to append these affixes to the root \"kolay\" would be:\n\n1. kolay + laş = kolaylaş (to become easy)\n2. kolaylaş + tır = kolaylaştır (to make something become easy)\n3. kolaylaştır + ma = kolaylaştırma (to not make something become easy)\n4. kolaylaştırma + sa = kolaylaştırmasa (if [he/she/it] does not make something become easy)\n\nSo the final word is \"kolaylaştırmasa\".\n\n<Answer>kolaylaştırmasa</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. laş\n2. ma\n3. tır\n4. sa\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, no extra affixes are included, and the final word is grammatically correct in Turkish.\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: yakala\nAffixes: ı, yacağ, ya, ma\nAnswer:",

Therefore, the correct construction is:\n\n- yakala (root) + ma (negation) = yakalamay\n- yakalamay + acağ (future tense) = yakalamayacağ\n- yakalamayacağ + ı (third person singular possessive) = yakalamayacağı\n\nThe final word is <Answer>yakalamayacağı</Answer>.\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- ma (negation)\n- yacağ (future tense)\n- ı (third person singular possessive)\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.

Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given affixes to the root. Use each affix exactly once. After forming a word, list each affix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no affix is used more than once, confirm that all provided affixes are used, verify that no extra affixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: kovala\nAffixes: diğ, yabil, im, iz\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"kovala\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"diğ\" is a relative suffix that turns a verb into an adjective or a noun.\n2. \"yabil\" is a potential mood suffix that indicates the ability to do the action of the verb.\n3. \"im\" is a possessive suffix for the first person singular.\n4. \"iz\" is a plural suffix for the first person.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be to first turn the verb into a potential mood, then make it into a noun with the relative suffix, and finally add the possessive and plural suffixes.\n\nSo, the construction would be as follows:\n- kovala (root) + yabil (potential mood) = kovalayabil\n- kovalayabil + diğ (relative suffix) = kovalayabildiğ\n- kovalayabildiğ + im (first person singular possessive) = kovalayabildiğim\n- kovalayabildiğim + iz (first person plural) = kovalayabildiğimiz\n\nThe final word is <Answer>kovalayabildiğimiz</Answer>.\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- yabil\n- diğ\n- im\n- iz\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: bebek\nAffixes: in, lik, ler, de\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions in Turkish:\n\n- \"in\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular (his/her/its).\n- \"lik\" is a suffix that can turn a noun into another noun, often indicating a state, condition, or quality.\n- \"ler\" is a plural suffix for nouns.\n- \"de\" is a locative suffix indicating the location (on, at, in).\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: bebek (baby)\n2. Add \"lik\" to form a noun that indicates a state or quality: bebeklik (childhood)\n3. Add \"ler\" to pluralize: bebeklikler (childhoods)\n4. Add \"in\" to indicate possession: bebekliklerin (of the childhoods)\n5. Add \"de\" to indicate location: bebekliklerinde (in the childhoods)\n\nThe final word is <Answer>bebekliklerinde</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- lik\n- ler\n- in\n- de\n\nAll provided affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: bulun\nAffixes: ma, ma, sı, na\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We have the root \"bulun\" and the affixes \"ma, ma, sı, na\". Since we have two \"ma\" affixes, we need to be careful about their placement and function in the word.\n\n1. The first \"ma\" is likely a negation suffix for verbs.\n2. The second \"ma\" could be a nominalization suffix, turning the verb into a noun.\n3. The \"sı\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular).\n4. The \"na\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nLet's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunma\" (not to be found)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its not being found)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its not being found)\n\nHowever, we still have one \"ma\" left, which is a nominalization suffix. We need to use it to turn the verb into a noun before we can add the possessive and dative suffixes:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (nominalization) = \"bulunma\" (the act of finding)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its finding)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its finding)\n4. \"bulunmasına\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunmamasına\" (to his/her/its not finding)\n\nNow we have used all the affixes correctly and constructed a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n<Answer>bulunmamasına</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. ma (nominalization)\n2. sı (possessive)\n3. na (dative)\n4. ma (negation)\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: şarkı\nAffixes: ki, lar, da, ın\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"şarkı\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"şarkı\" is the root word meaning \"song\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix.\n3. \"ın\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular \"his/her/its\").\n4. \"da\" is a locative suffix (meaning \"in/at\").\n5. \"ki\" is a suffix that is used to form an adjective from a noun phrase.\n\nThe correct order for the affixes would be:\n\n1. \"şarkı\" + \"lar\" = \"şarkılar\" (songs)\n2. \"şarkılar\" + \"ın\" = \"şarkıların\" (of the songs)\n3. \"şarkıların\" + \"da\" = \"şarkılarında\" (in their songs)\n4. \"şarkılarında\" + \"ki\" = \"şarkılarındaki\" (the ones in their songs)\n\nSo the final word is \"şarkılarındaki\".\n\n<Answer>şarkılarındaki</Answer>\n\nList of affixes used in order:\n1. lar\n2. ın\n3. da\n4. ki\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: kolay\nAffixes: laş, ma, tır, sa\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and the order in which they should be appended to the root \"kolay\" to form a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n1. \"laş\" - This is a derivational suffix that can be used to form an adjective or verb, often indicating becoming or getting to be in the state of the root.\n2. \"ma\" - This is a negation suffix that is often used to form the negative of verbs.\n3. \"tır\" - This is a causative suffix that can be used to form verbs that mean to make or cause to do something.\n4. \"sa\" - This is a conditional suffix that is used to form the conditional mood of verbs.\n\nThe correct order to append these affixes to the root \"kolay\" would be:\n\n1. kolay + laş = kolaylaş (to become easy)\n2. kolaylaş + tır = kolaylaştır (to make something become easy)\n3. kolaylaştır + ma = kolaylaştırma (to not make something become easy)\n4. kolaylaştırma + sa = kolaylaştırmasa (if [he/she/it] does not make something become easy)\n\nSo the final word is \"kolaylaştırmasa\".\n\n<Answer>kolaylaştırmasa</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. laş\n2. ma\n3. tır\n4. sa\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, no extra affixes are included, and the final word is grammatically correct in Turkish.\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: izle\nAffixes: e, diğ, in, n\nAnswer:",

We need to use it to turn the verb into a noun before we can add the possessive and dative suffixes:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (nominalization) = \"bulunma\" (the act of finding)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its finding)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its finding)\n4. \"bulunmasına\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunmamasına\" (to his/her/its not finding)\n\nNow we have used all the affixes correctly and constructed a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n<Answer>bulunmamasına</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. ma (nominalization)\n2. sı (possessive)\n3. na (dative)\n4. ma (negation)\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: şarkı\nAffixes: ki, lar, da, ın\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"şarkı\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"şarkı\" is the root word meaning \"song\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix.\n3. \"ın\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular \"his/her/its\").\n4. \"da\" is a locative suffix (meaning \"in/at\").\n5. \"ki\" is a suffix that is used to form an adjective from a noun phrase.\n\nThe correct order for the affixes would be:\n\n1. \"şarkı\" + \"lar\" = \"şarkılar\" (songs)\n2. \"şarkılar\" + \"ın\" = \"şarkıların\" (of the songs)\n3. \"şarkıların\" + \"da\" = \"şarkılarında\" (in their songs)\n4. \"şarkılarında\" + \"ki\" = \"şarkılarındaki\" (the ones in their songs)\n\nSo the final word is \"şarkılarındaki\".\n\n<Answer>şarkılarındaki</Answer>\n\nList of affixes used in order:\n1. lar\n2. ın\n3. da\n4. ki\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: kolay\nAffixes: laş, ma, tır, sa\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and the order in which they should be appended to the root \"kolay\" to form a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n1. \"laş\" - This is a derivational suffix that can be used to form an adjective or verb, often indicating becoming or getting to be in the state of the root.\n2. \"ma\" - This is a negation suffix that is often used to form the negative of verbs.\n3. \"tır\" - This is a causative suffix that can be used to form verbs that mean to make or cause to do something.\n4. \"sa\" - This is a conditional suffix that is used to form the conditional mood of verbs.\n\nThe correct order to append these affixes to the root \"kolay\" would be:\n\n1. kolay + laş = kolaylaş (to become easy)\n2. kolaylaş + tır = kolaylaştır (to make something become easy)\n3. kolaylaştır + ma = kolaylaştırma (to not make something become easy)\n4. kolaylaştırma + sa = kolaylaştırmasa (if [he/she/it] does not make something become easy)\n\nSo the final word is \"kolaylaştırmasa\".\n\n<Answer>kolaylaştırmasa</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. laş\n2. ma\n3. tır\n4. sa\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, no extra affixes are included, and the final word is grammatically correct in Turkish.\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: şaşır\nAffixes: ı, ma, ım, dığ\nAnswer:",

We will append the affixes to the root \"kovala\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"diğ\" is a relative suffix that turns a verb into an adjective or a noun.\n2. \"yabil\" is a potential mood suffix that indicates the ability to do the action of the verb.\n3. \"im\" is a possessive suffix for the first person singular.\n4. \"iz\" is a plural suffix for the first person.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be to first turn the verb into a potential mood, then make it into a noun with the relative suffix, and finally add the possessive and plural suffixes.\n\nSo, the construction would be as follows:\n- kovala (root) + yabil (potential mood) = kovalayabil\n- kovalayabil + diğ (relative suffix) = kovalayabildiğ\n- kovalayabildiğ + im (first person singular possessive) = kovalayabildiğim\n- kovalayabildiğim + iz (first person plural) = kovalayabildiğimiz\n\nThe final word is <Answer>kovalayabildiğimiz</Answer>.\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- yabil\n- diğ\n- im\n- iz\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: bebek\nAffixes: in, lik, ler, de\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions in Turkish:\n\n- \"in\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular (his/her/its).\n- \"lik\" is a suffix that can turn a noun into another noun, often indicating a state, condition, or quality.\n- \"ler\" is a plural suffix for nouns.\n- \"de\" is a locative suffix indicating the location (on, at, in).\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: bebek (baby)\n2. Add \"lik\" to form a noun that indicates a state or quality: bebeklik (childhood)\n3. Add \"ler\" to pluralize: bebeklikler (childhoods)\n4. Add \"in\" to indicate possession: bebekliklerin (of the childhoods)\n5. Add \"de\" to indicate location: bebekliklerinde (in the childhoods)\n\nThe final word is <Answer>bebekliklerinde</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- lik\n- ler\n- in\n- de\n\nAll provided affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: bulun\nAffixes: ma, ma, sı, na\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We have the root \"bulun\" and the affixes \"ma, ma, sı, na\". Since we have two \"ma\" affixes, we need to be careful about their placement and function in the word.\n\n1. The first \"ma\" is likely a negation suffix for verbs.\n2. The second \"ma\" could be a nominalization suffix, turning the verb into a noun.\n3. The \"sı\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular).\n4. The \"na\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nLet's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunma\" (not to be found)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its not being found)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its not being found)\n\nHowever, we still have one \"ma\" left, which is a nominalization suffix.

We will append the affixes to the root \"kavram\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"kavram\" (concept) is the root.\n2. \"sal\" is a suffix that turns a noun into an adjective (related to).\n3. \"laş\" is a suffix that indicates becoming or getting to be.\n4. \"tır\" is a causative suffix.\n5. \"ma\" is a nominalization suffix that turns a verb into a noun.\n6. \"ya\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. kavram + sal = kavramsal (conceptual)\n2. kavramsal + laş = kavramsallaş (become conceptual)\n3. kavramsallaş + tır = kavramsallaştır (to make conceptual)\n4. kavramsallaştır + ma = kavramsallaştırma (the act of making conceptual)\n5. kavramsallaştırma + ya = kavramsallaştırmaya (to the act of making conceptual)\n\nThe final word is \"kavramsallaştırmaya\".\n\n<Answer>kavramsallaştırmaya</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. sal\n2. laş\n3. tır\n4. ma\n5. ya\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: derin\nAffixes: in, tir, iz, leş, diğ\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"derin\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"derin\" (deep)\n2. \"derin\" + \"leş\" = \"derinleş\" (to become deep)\n3. \"derinleş\" + \"tir\" = \"derinleştir\" (to make something become deep)\n4. \"derinleştir\" + \"diğ\" = \"derinleştirdiğ\" (that which has made something become deep - a participle form)\n5. \"derinleştirdiğ\" + \"in\" = \"derinleştirdiğin\" (that which you have made become deep - second person singular possessive)\n6. \"derinleştirdiğin\" + \"iz\" = \"derinleştirdiğiniz\" (that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep - second person plural possessive)\n\nThe final word is \"derinleştirdiğiniz,\" and it means \"that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep.\"\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- leş\n- tir\n- diğ\n- in\n- iz\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>derinleştirdiğiniz</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: yapıt\nAffixes: lar, den, da, ki, ler\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. The affixes provided need to be appended in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"ler\" or \"lar\" - Plural suffix, used to pluralize nouns or adjectives. It must agree in vowel harmony with the word root.\n2. \"den\" - Ablative case suffix, indicating \"from\" or \"than\" something.\n3. \"da\" - Locative case suffix, indicating \"in\" or \"at\" something.\n4. \"ki\" - A suffix that forms an adjective from a noun or pronoun, often equivalent to the English \"that\" or \"which.\"\n\nGiven the word root \"yapıt\" (which means \"work\" or \"piece of art\"), we need to determine the correct order of affixes. The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"yapıt\" (root)\n2. \"lar\" (plural suffix, because \"yapıt\" ends with a back vowel, we use \"lar\" instead of \"ler\" for vowel harmony)\n3. \"da\" (locative case suffix, to be used after pluralizing the noun)\n4. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix, which should come after the case suffix)\n5. \"den\" (ablative case suffix, which should be the last one as it indicates \"from\" the previously described location)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"yapıtlardakilerden\".\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"den\" (ablative case suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nThe final answer is: <Answer>yapıtlardakilerden</Answer>.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: kaynak\nAffixes: dır, mak, lan, ma, ta\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the correct order of affixes. The root word is \"kaynak,\" and the affixes are \"dır,\" \"mak,\" \"lan,\" \"ma,\" \"ta.\" \n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of affixes we have:\n- \"mak\" is a verbal infinitive marker.\n- \"lan\" is a reflexive/passive voice marker for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation marker for verbs.\n- \"ta\" is a locative case marker for nouns.\n- \"dır\" is a verbal/nominal predicate marker for certainty/definiteness.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first turn the noun into a verb, then apply reflexivity/passivity if needed, followed by negation, and then the infinitive if we are creating a verb to be used as a noun or another part of speech. Then we can add the locative case and the predicate marker.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kaynak\" would be:\n1. \"lan\" to make it reflexive/passive.\n2. \"ma\" to negate it.\n3. \"mak\" to put it into the infinitive form.\n4. \"ta\" to indicate the state.\n5.\"dır\" to indicate the certainty.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kaynaklanmamaktadır,\" which means \"it is not in the state of not to originate from/be sourced from.\"\n\n<Answer>kaynaklanmamaktadır</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: karşı\nAffixes: abil, eceğ, im, iz, laş\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"abil\" is a potential mood suffix that can be attached to verbs to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb.\n- \"eceğ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"im\" is a first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"iz\" is a first-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"laş\" is a reciprocal or reflexive verb-forming suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"karşı\" can function as a noun or an adjective. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb first. We can do this by adding the reflexive/reciprocal suffix \"laş\" to form \"karşılaş,\" which means \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the final word is <Answer>karşılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- laş\n- abil\n- eceğ\n- im\n- iz\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: hayal\nAffixes: de, ler, ni, imiz, ki\nAnswer:",

We will append the affixes to the root \"kavram\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"kavram\" (concept) is the root.\n2. \"sal\" is a suffix that turns a noun into an adjective (related to).\n3. \"laş\" is a suffix that indicates becoming or getting to be.\n4. \"tır\" is a causative suffix.\n5. \"ma\" is a nominalization suffix that turns a verb into a noun.\n6. \"ya\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. kavram + sal = kavramsal (conceptual)\n2. kavramsal + laş = kavramsallaş (become conceptual)\n3. kavramsallaş + tır = kavramsallaştır (to make conceptual)\n4. kavramsallaştır + ma = kavramsallaştırma (the act of making conceptual)\n5. kavramsallaştırma + ya = kavramsallaştırmaya (to the act of making conceptual)\n\nThe final word is \"kavramsallaştırmaya\".\n\n<Answer>kavramsallaştırmaya</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. sal\n2. laş\n3. tır\n4. ma\n5. ya\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: derin\nAffixes: in, tir, iz, leş, diğ\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"derin\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"derin\" (deep)\n2. \"derin\" + \"leş\" = \"derinleş\" (to become deep)\n3. \"derinleş\" + \"tir\" = \"derinleştir\" (to make something become deep)\n4. \"derinleştir\" + \"diğ\" = \"derinleştirdiğ\" (that which has made something become deep - a participle form)\n5. \"derinleştirdiğ\" + \"in\" = \"derinleştirdiğin\" (that which you have made become deep - second person singular possessive)\n6. \"derinleştirdiğin\" + \"iz\" = \"derinleştirdiğiniz\" (that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep - second person plural possessive)\n\nThe final word is \"derinleştirdiğiniz,\" and it means \"that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep.\"\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- leş\n- tir\n- diğ\n- in\n- iz\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>derinleştirdiğiniz</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: yapıt\nAffixes: lar, den, da, ki, ler\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. The affixes provided need to be appended in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"ler\" or \"lar\" - Plural suffix, used to pluralize nouns or adjectives. It must agree in vowel harmony with the word root.\n2. \"den\" - Ablative case suffix, indicating \"from\" or \"than\" something.\n3. \"da\" - Locative case suffix, indicating \"in\" or \"at\" something.\n4. \"ki\" - A suffix that forms an adjective from a noun or pronoun, often equivalent to the English \"that\" or \"which.\"\n\nGiven the word root \"yapıt\" (which means \"work\" or \"piece of art\"), we need to determine the correct order of affixes. The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"yapıt\" (root)\n2. \"lar\" (plural suffix, because \"yapıt\" ends with a back vowel, we use \"lar\" instead of \"ler\" for vowel harmony)\n3. \"da\" (locative case suffix, to be used after pluralizing the noun)\n4. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix, which should come after the case suffix)\n5. \"den\" (ablative case suffix, which should be the last one as it indicates \"from\" the previously described location)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"yapıtlardakilerden\".\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"den\" (ablative case suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nThe final answer is: <Answer>yapıtlardakilerden</Answer>.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: kaynak\nAffixes: dır, mak, lan, ma, ta\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the correct order of affixes. The root word is \"kaynak,\" and the affixes are \"dır,\" \"mak,\" \"lan,\" \"ma,\" \"ta.\" \n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of affixes we have:\n- \"mak\" is a verbal infinitive marker.\n- \"lan\" is a reflexive/passive voice marker for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation marker for verbs.\n- \"ta\" is a locative case marker for nouns.\n- \"dır\" is a verbal/nominal predicate marker for certainty/definiteness.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first turn the noun into a verb, then apply reflexivity/passivity if needed, followed by negation, and then the infinitive if we are creating a verb to be used as a noun or another part of speech. Then we can add the locative case and the predicate marker.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kaynak\" would be:\n1. \"lan\" to make it reflexive/passive.\n2. \"ma\" to negate it.\n3. \"mak\" to put it into the infinitive form.\n4. \"ta\" to indicate the state.\n5.\"dır\" to indicate the certainty.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kaynaklanmamaktadır,\" which means \"it is not in the state of not to originate from/be sourced from.\"\n\n<Answer>kaynaklanmamaktadır</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: karşı\nAffixes: abil, eceğ, im, iz, laş\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"abil\" is a potential mood suffix that can be attached to verbs to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb.\n- \"eceğ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"im\" is a first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"iz\" is a first-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"laş\" is a reciprocal or reflexive verb-forming suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"karşı\" can function as a noun or an adjective. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb first. We can do this by adding the reflexive/reciprocal suffix \"laş\" to form \"karşılaş,\" which means \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the final word is <Answer>karşılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- laş\n- abil\n- eceğ\n- im\n- iz\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: eğlen\nAffixes: du, m, k, iyor, e\nAnswer:",

The past tense marker \"du\" and the narrative marker \"k\" are not compatible with the present continuous tense in this context, and the dative case suffix \"e\" is typically not used with verbs in this form.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a present continuous verb from \"eğlen\" would be:\n1. \"iyor\" to indicate present continuous tense.\n2. \"m\" to indicate the first person singular.\n\nThe constructed word is \"eğleniyorum,\" which means \"I am enjoying\" or \"I am having fun.\"\n\n<Answer>eğleniyorum</Answer>\n\nThe affixes \"du,\" \"k,\" and \"e\" are not used in this construction because they do not fit grammatically with the present continuous tense form of the verb \"eğlen.\" The final word uses only the affixes \"iyor\" and \"m\" to convey the correct meaning in the present continuous tense.",

The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"yapıt\" (root)\n2. \"lar\" (plural suffix, because \"yapıt\" ends with a back vowel, we use \"lar\" instead of \"ler\" for vowel harmony)\n3. \"da\" (locative case suffix, to be used after pluralizing the noun)\n4. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix, which should come after the case suffix)\n5. \"den\" (ablative case suffix, which should be the last one as it indicates \"from\" the previously described location)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"yapıtlardakilerden\".\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"den\" (ablative case suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nThe final answer is: <Answer>yapıtlardakilerden</Answer>.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: kaynak\nAffixes: dır, mak, lan, ma, ta\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the correct order of affixes. The root word is \"kaynak,\" and the affixes are \"dır,\" \"mak,\" \"lan,\" \"ma,\" \"ta.\" \n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of affixes we have:\n- \"mak\" is a verbal infinitive marker.\n- \"lan\" is a reflexive/passive voice marker for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation marker for verbs.\n- \"ta\" is a locative case marker for nouns.\n- \"dır\" is a verbal/nominal predicate marker for certainty/definiteness.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first turn the noun into a verb, then apply reflexivity/passivity if needed, followed by negation, and then the infinitive if we are creating a verb to be used as a noun or another part of speech. Then we can add the locative case and the predicate marker.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kaynak\" would be:\n1. \"lan\" to make it reflexive/passive.\n2. \"ma\" to negate it.\n3. \"mak\" to put it into the infinitive form.\n4. \"ta\" to indicate the state.\n5.\"dır\" to indicate the certainty.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kaynaklanmamaktadır,\" which means \"it is not in the state of not to originate from/be sourced from.\"\n\n<Answer>kaynaklanmamaktadır</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: karşı\nAffixes: abil, eceğ, im, iz, laş\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"abil\" is a potential mood suffix that can be attached to verbs to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb.\n- \"eceğ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"im\" is a first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"iz\" is a first-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"laş\" is a reciprocal or reflexive verb-forming suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"karşı\" can function as a noun or an adjective. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb first. We can do this by adding the reflexive/reciprocal suffix \"laş\" to form \"karşılaş,\" which means \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the final word is <Answer>karşılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- laş\n- abil\n- eceğ\n- im\n- iz\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: çıkar\nAffixes: ma, yacağ, a, ı, ım\nAnswer:",

Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the final word is <Answer>karşılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- laş\n- abil\n- eceğ\n- im\n- iz\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: bağ\nAffixes: lığ, lı, ım, nın, ı\nAnswer:",

The affixes provided need to be appended in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"ler\" or \"lar\" - Plural suffix, used to pluralize nouns or adjectives. It must agree in vowel harmony with the word root.\n2. \"den\" - Ablative case suffix, indicating \"from\" or \"than\" something.\n3. \"da\" - Locative case suffix, indicating \"in\" or \"at\" something.\n4. \"ki\" - A suffix that forms an adjective from a noun or pronoun, often equivalent to the English \"that\" or \"which.\"\n\nGiven the word root \"yapıt\" (which means \"work\" or \"piece of art\"), we need to determine the correct order of affixes. The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"yapıt\" (root)\n2. \"lar\" (plural suffix, because \"yapıt\" ends with a back vowel, we use \"lar\" instead of \"ler\" for vowel harmony)\n3. \"da\" (locative case suffix, to be used after pluralizing the noun)\n4. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix, which should come after the case suffix)\n5. \"den\" (ablative case suffix, which should be the last one as it indicates \"from\" the previously described location)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"yapıtlardakilerden\".\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"den\" (ablative case suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nThe final answer is: <Answer>yapıtlardakilerden</Answer>.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: kaynak\nAffixes: dır, mak, lan, ma, ta\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the correct order of affixes. The root word is \"kaynak,\" and the affixes are \"dır,\" \"mak,\" \"lan,\" \"ma,\" \"ta.\" \n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of affixes we have:\n- \"mak\" is a verbal infinitive marker.\n- \"lan\" is a reflexive/passive voice marker for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation marker for verbs.\n- \"ta\" is a locative case marker for nouns.\n- \"dır\" is a verbal/nominal predicate marker for certainty/definiteness.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first turn the noun into a verb, then apply reflexivity/passivity if needed, followed by negation, and then the infinitive if we are creating a verb to be used as a noun or another part of speech. Then we can add the locative case and the predicate marker.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kaynak\" would be:\n1. \"lan\" to make it reflexive/passive.\n2. \"ma\" to negate it.\n3. \"mak\" to put it into the infinitive form.\n4. \"ta\" to indicate the state.\n5.\"dır\" to indicate the certainty.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kaynaklanmamaktadır,\" which means \"it is not in the state of not to originate from/be sourced from.\"\n\n<Answer>kaynaklanmamaktadır</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: karşı\nAffixes: abil, eceğ, im, iz, laş\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"abil\" is a potential mood suffix that can be attached to verbs to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb.\n- \"eceğ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"im\" is a first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"iz\" is a first-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"laş\" is a reciprocal or reflexive verb-forming suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"karşı\" can function as a noun or an adjective. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb first. We can do this by adding the reflexive/reciprocal suffix \"laş\" to form \"karşılaş,\" which means \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the final word is <Answer>karşılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- laş\n- abil\n- eceğ\n- im\n- iz\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: kurtul\nAffixes: a, nı, yacağ, ma, ı\nAnswer:",

            "model_output": "To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. The root word \"kurtul\" is already a verb meaning \"to get rid of\" or \"to be saved.\" Now, let's analyze the affixes:\n\n- \"a\" is a dative case suffix.\n- \"nı\" is a second-person singular object suffix (accusative case).\n- \"yacağ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation suffix for verbs.\n- \"ı\" is a third-person singular possessive suffix.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first apply the future tense, then negation, and then the object and dative case suffixes. The possessive suffix \"ı\" does not fit with the verb form and is likely intended for a noun, so it seems out of place in this context.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kurtul\" would be:\n1. \"yacağ\" to indicate the future tense.\n2. \"ma\" to negate the verb.\n3. \"nı\" as the object suffix for the second person singular.\n4. \"a\" as the dative case suffix.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kurtulmayacağını,\" which means \"(that) you will not get rid of.\"\n\n<Answer>kurtulmayacağını</Answer>\n\nThe affix \"ı\" is not used because it does not fit grammatically with the verb form we have created.

Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: kavram\nAffixes: tır, sal, ya, laş, ma\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"kavram\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"kavram\" (concept) is the root.\n2. \"sal\" is a suffix that turns a noun into an adjective (related to).\n3. \"laş\" is a suffix that indicates becoming or getting to be.\n4. \"tır\" is a causative suffix.\n5. \"ma\" is a nominalization suffix that turns a verb into a noun.\n6. \"ya\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. kavram + sal = kavramsal (conceptual)\n2. kavramsal + laş = kavramsallaş (become conceptual)\n3. kavramsallaş + tır = kavramsallaştır (to make conceptual)\n4. kavramsallaştır + ma = kavramsallaştırma (the act of making conceptual)\n5. kavramsallaştırma + ya = kavramsallaştırmaya (to the act of making conceptual)\n\nThe final word is \"kavramsallaştırmaya\".\n\n<Answer>kavramsallaştırmaya</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. sal\n2. laş\n3. tır\n4. ma\n5. ya\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: derin\nAffixes: in, tir, iz, leş, diğ\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"derin\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"derin\" (deep)\n2. \"derin\" + \"leş\" = \"derinleş\" (to become deep)\n3. \"derinleş\" + \"tir\" = \"derinleştir\" (to make something become deep)\n4. \"derinleştir\" + \"diğ\" = \"derinleştirdiğ\" (that which has made something become deep - a participle form)\n5. \"derinleştirdiğ\" + \"in\" = \"derinleştirdiğin\" (that which you have made become deep - second person singular possessive)\n6. \"derinleştirdiğin\" + \"iz\" = \"derinleştirdiğiniz\" (that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep - second person plural possessive)\n\nThe final word is \"derinleştirdiğiniz,\" and it means \"that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep.\"\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- leş\n- tir\n- diğ\n- in\n- iz\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>derinleştirdiğiniz</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: yapıt\nAffixes: lar, den, da, ki, ler\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. The affixes provided need to be appended in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"ler\" or \"lar\" - Plural suffix, used to pluralize nouns or adjectives. It must agree in vowel harmony with the word root.\n2. \"den\" - Ablative case suffix, indicating \"from\" or \"than\" something.\n3. \"da\" - Locative case suffix, indicating \"in\" or \"at\" something.\n4. \"ki\" - A suffix that forms an adjective from a noun or pronoun, often equivalent to the English \"that\" or \"which.\"\n\nGiven the word root \"yapıt\" (which means \"work\" or \"piece of art\"), we need to determine the correct order of affixes. The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"yapıt\" (root)\n2. \"lar\" (plural suffix, because \"yapıt\" ends with a back vowel, we use \"lar\" instead of \"ler\" for vowel harmony)\n3. \"da\" (locative case suffix, to be used after pluralizing the noun)\n4. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix, which should come after the case suffix)\n5. \"den\" (ablative case suffix, which should be the last one as it indicates \"from\" the previously described location)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"yapıtlardakilerden\".\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"den\" (ablative case suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nThe final answer is: <Answer>yapıtlardakilerden</Answer>.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: kaynak\nAffixes: dır, mak, lan, ma, ta\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the correct order of affixes. The root word is \"kaynak,\" and the affixes are \"dır,\" \"mak,\" \"lan,\" \"ma,\" \"ta.\" \n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of affixes we have:\n- \"mak\" is a verbal infinitive marker.\n- \"lan\" is a reflexive/passive voice marker for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation marker for verbs.\n- \"ta\" is a locative case marker for nouns.\n- \"dır\" is a verbal/nominal predicate marker for certainty/definiteness.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first turn the noun into a verb, then apply reflexivity/passivity if needed, followed by negation, and then the infinitive if we are creating a verb to be used as a noun or another part of speech. Then we can add the locative case and the predicate marker.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kaynak\" would be:\n1. \"lan\" to make it reflexive/passive.\n2. \"ma\" to negate it.\n3. \"mak\" to put it into the infinitive form.\n4. \"ta\" to indicate the state.\n5.\"dır\" to indicate the certainty.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kaynaklanmamaktadır,\" which means \"it is not in the state of not to originate from/be sourced from.\"\n\n<Answer>kaynaklanmamaktadır</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: karşı\nAffixes: abil, eceğ, im, iz, laş\nAnswer: First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"abil\" is a potential mood suffix that can be attached to verbs to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb.\n- \"eceğ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"im\" is a first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"iz\" is a first-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"laş\" is a reciprocal or reflexive verb-forming suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"karşı\" can function as a noun or an adjective. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb first. We can do this by adding the reflexive/reciprocal suffix \"laş\" to form \"karşılaş,\" which means \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the final word is <Answer>karşılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- laş\n- abil\n- eceğ\n- im\n- iz\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: kısıt\nAffixes: sın, ya, la, ma, z\nAnswer:",

The root word \"kucak\" means \"lap\" or \"embrace\" in English. We need to follow Turkish grammar rules, which typically involve adding suffixes in a certain order, such as making the word plural, then adding tense, case, etc.\n\n1. kucak + la = kucakla (embrace with)\n2. kucakla + ma = kucaklama (do not embrace)\n3. kucaklama + dık = kucaklamadık (we did not embrace)\n4. kucaklamadık + lar = kucaklamadıklar (those that we did not embrace)\n5. kucaklamadıklar + ın = kucaklamadıkların (of those that we did not embrace)\n6. kucaklamadıkların + ı = kucaklamadıklarını (those that you did not embrace - accusative case)\n\nNow we have a grammatically correct word in Turkish:\n\n<Answer>kucaklamadıklarını</Answer>\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- la\n- ma\n- dık\n- lar\n- ın\n- ı\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: kaygı\nAffixes: lar, ma, ı, ma, ın, lan\nAnswer: First, let's list the affixes provided:\n\n1. lar\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ı\n4. ma (second occurrence)\n5. ın\n6. lan\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\" to make it a verb: kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamanın\n6. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamanını\n7. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamanınlar\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the plural affix \"lar\" cannot be directly added to the possessive form in Turkish. The correct order should be:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\": kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamalar\n6. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamaların\n7. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamalarını\n\nThe correct word constructed by using each affix exactly once and in a grammatically correct order is <Answer>kaygılanmamalarını</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. lan\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ma (second occurrence)\n4. lar\n5. ın\n6. ı\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: sorgu\nAffixes: i, la, dik, ler, ni, yabil\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax.

Check the following: Ensure no affix is used more than once, confirm that all provided affixes are used, verify that no extra affixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: başar\nAffixes: ımız, a, ma, lar, la, dık\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"başar\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"başar\" (root) - to succeed\n2. \"başar + a\" - to be able to suceed\n3. \"başar + a + ma\" (negation) - not to succeed\n4. \"başar + a + ma + dık\" (past tense for negative) - we could not succeed\n5. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar\" (first person plural) - this is redundant since \"ımız\" already indicates first person plural, but in Turkish, sometimes double plural markers are used for emphasis or collective meaning\n6. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar + ımız\" (plural suffix) - the ones where we could not succeed\n7. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar + ımız + la\" (instrumental/comitative case) - with the ones where we could not succeed\n\nThe final constructed word is \"başaramadıklarımızla\".\n\n<Answer>başaramadıklarımızla</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:1. a\n2. ma\n3. dık\n4. lar\n5. ımız\n7. la\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: bırak\nAffixes: ecek, abil, ıl, ler, i, ni\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will start with the root \"bırak\" and then add the affixes in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. Root: bırak\n2. Future tense: ecek (bırakacak)\n3. Ability mood: abil (bırakabilecek)\n4. Passive voice: ıl (bırakılabilecek)\n5. Third person plural: ler (bırakılabilecekler)\n6. Accusative case: i (bırakılabilecekleri)\n7. Genitive case: ni (bırakılabileceklerini)\n\nNow, let's put them all together:\n\nbırak + abil + ecek + ıl + ler + i + ni = bırakılabileceklerini\n\nSo the final word is:\n\n<Answer>bırakılabileceklerini</Answer>\n\nAnd here is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- abil\n- ecek\n- ıl\n- ler\n- i\n- ni\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: kucak\nAffixes: lar, ın, ı, la, dık, ma\nAnswer: First, let's determine the order of the affixes to create a grammatically correct word in Turkish. The root word \"kucak\" means \"lap\" or \"embrace\" in English. We need to follow Turkish grammar rules, which typically involve adding suffixes in a certain order, such as making the word plural, then adding tense, case, etc.\n\n1. kucak + la = kucakla (embrace with)\n2. kucakla + ma = kucaklama (do not embrace)\n3. kucaklama + dık = kucaklamadık (we did not embrace)\n4. kucaklamadık + lar = kucaklamadıklar (those that we did not embrace)\n5. kucaklamadıklar + ın = kucaklamadıkların (of those that we did not embrace)\n6. kucaklamadıkların + ı = kucaklamadıklarını (those that you did not embrace - accusative case)\n\nNow we have a grammatically correct word in Turkish:\n\n<Answer>kucaklamadıklarını</Answer>\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- la\n- ma\n- dık\n- lar\n- ın\n- ı\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: kaygı\nAffixes: lar, ma, ı, ma, ın, lan\nAnswer: First, let's list the affixes provided:\n\n1. lar\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ı\n4. ma (second occurrence)\n5. ın\n6. lan\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\" to make it a verb: kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamanın\n6. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamanını\n7. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamanınlar\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the plural affix \"lar\" cannot be directly added to the possessive form in Turkish. The correct order should be:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\": kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamalar\n6. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamaların\n7. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamalarını\n\nThe correct word constructed by using each affix exactly once and in a grammatically correct order is <Answer>kaygılanmamalarını</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. lan\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ma (second occurrence)\n4. lar\n5. ın\n6. ı\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: sorgu\nAffixes: i, la, dik, ler, ni, yabil\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"sorgu\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar.\n\n1. \"sorgu\" (interrogation)\n2. \"sorgu\" + \"la\" = \"sorgula\" (interrogate)\n3. \"sorgula\" + \"yabil\" = \"sorgulayabil\" (can interrogate)\n4. \"sorgulayabil\" + \"dik\" = \"sorgulayabildik\" (we were able to interrogate)\n5. \"sorgulayabildik\" + \"i\" = \"sorgulayabildiği\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate)\n6. \"sorgulayabildiği\" + \"ni\" = \"sorgulayabildiğini\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate - accusative case, often used to indicate direct object of a verb)\n7. \"sorgulayabildiğini\" + \"ler\" = \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" (that they were able to interrogate - plural)\n\nThe final word is \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" and the affixes used are:\n\n- la\n- yabil\n- dik\n- i\n- ni\n- ler\n\n<Answer>sorgulayabildiklerini</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: uğra\nAffixes: ş, ıcı, dan, lığ, tır, ın\nAnswer:",

We will append the affixes to the root \"başar\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"başar\" (root) - to succeed\n2. \"başar + a\" - to be able to suceed\n3. \"başar + a + ma\" (negation) - not to succeed\n4. \"başar + a + ma + dık\" (past tense for negative) - we could not succeed\n5. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar\" (first person plural) - this is redundant since \"ımız\" already indicates first person plural, but in Turkish, sometimes double plural markers are used for emphasis or collective meaning\n6. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar + ımız\" (plural suffix) - the ones where we could not succeed\n7. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar + ımız + la\" (instrumental/comitative case) - with the ones where we could not succeed\n\nThe final constructed word is \"başaramadıklarımızla\".\n\n<Answer>başaramadıklarımızla</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:1. a\n2. ma\n3. dık\n4. lar\n5. ımız\n7. la\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: bırak\nAffixes: ecek, abil, ıl, ler, i, ni\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will start with the root \"bırak\" and then add the affixes in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. Root: bırak\n2. Future tense: ecek (bırakacak)\n3. Ability mood: abil (bırakabilecek)\n4. Passive voice: ıl (bırakılabilecek)\n5. Third person plural: ler (bırakılabilecekler)\n6. Accusative case: i (bırakılabilecekleri)\n7. Genitive case: ni (bırakılabileceklerini)\n\nNow, let's put them all together:\n\nbırak + abil + ecek + ıl + ler + i + ni = bırakılabileceklerini\n\nSo the final word is:\n\n<Answer>bırakılabileceklerini</Answer>\n\nAnd here is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- abil\n- ecek\n- ıl\n- ler\n- i\n- ni\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: kucak\nAffixes: lar, ın, ı, la, dık, ma\nAnswer: First, let's determine the order of the affixes to create a grammatically correct word in Turkish. The root word \"kucak\" means \"lap\" or \"embrace\" in English. We need to follow Turkish grammar rules, which typically involve adding suffixes in a certain order, such as making the word plural, then adding tense, case, etc.\n\n1. kucak + la = kucakla (embrace with)\n2. kucakla + ma = kucaklama (do not embrace)\n3. kucaklama + dık = kucaklamadık (we did not embrace)\n4. kucaklamadık + lar = kucaklamadıklar (those that we did not embrace)\n5. kucaklamadıklar + ın = kucaklamadıkların (of those that we did not embrace)\n6. kucaklamadıkların + ı = kucaklamadıklarını (those that you did not embrace - accusative case)\n\nNow we have a grammatically correct word in Turkish:\n\n<Answer>kucaklamadıklarını</Answer>\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- la\n- ma\n- dık\n- lar\n- ın\n- ı\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: kaygı\nAffixes: lar, ma, ı, ma, ın, lan\nAnswer: First, let's list the affixes provided:\n\n1. lar\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ı\n4. ma (second occurrence)\n5. ın\n6. lan\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\" to make it a verb: kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamanın\n6. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamanını\n7. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamanınlar\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the plural affix \"lar\" cannot be directly added to the possessive form in Turkish. The correct order should be:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\": kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamalar\n6. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamaların\n7. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamalarını\n\nThe correct word constructed by using each affix exactly once and in a grammatically correct order is <Answer>kaygılanmamalarını</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. lan\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ma (second occurrence)\n4. lar\n5. ın\n6. ı\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: sorgu\nAffixes: i, la, dik, ler, ni, yabil\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"sorgu\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar.\n\n1. \"sorgu\" (interrogation)\n2. \"sorgu\" + \"la\" = \"sorgula\" (interrogate)\n3. \"sorgula\" + \"yabil\" = \"sorgulayabil\" (can interrogate)\n4. \"sorgulayabil\" + \"dik\" = \"sorgulayabildik\" (we were able to interrogate)\n5. \"sorgulayabildik\" + \"i\" = \"sorgulayabildiği\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate)\n6. \"sorgulayabildiği\" + \"ni\" = \"sorgulayabildiğini\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate - accusative case, often used to indicate direct object of a verb)\n7. \"sorgulayabildiğini\" + \"ler\" = \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" (that they were able to interrogate - plural)\n\nThe final word is \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" and the affixes used are:\n\n- la\n- yabil\n- dik\n- i\n- ni\n- ler\n\n<Answer>sorgulayabildiklerini</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: konuş\nAffixes: lar, dık, ın, ma, a, a\nAnswer:",

Check the following: Ensure no affix is used more than once, confirm that all provided affixes are used, verify that no extra affixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: başar\nAffixes: ımız, a, ma, lar, la, dık\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"başar\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"başar\" (root) - to succeed\n2. \"başar + a\" - to be able to suceed\n3. \"başar + a + ma\" (negation) - not to succeed\n4. \"başar + a + ma + dık\" (past tense for negative) - we could not succeed\n5. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar\" (first person plural) - this is redundant since \"ımız\" already indicates first person plural, but in Turkish, sometimes double plural markers are used for emphasis or collective meaning\n6. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar + ımız\" (plural suffix) - the ones where we could not succeed\n7. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar + ımız + la\" (instrumental/comitative case) - with the ones where we could not succeed\n\nThe final constructed word is \"başaramadıklarımızla\".\n\n<Answer>başaramadıklarımızla</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:1. a\n2. ma\n3. dık\n4. lar\n5. ımız\n7. la\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: bırak\nAffixes: ecek, abil, ıl, ler, i, ni\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will start with the root \"bırak\" and then add the affixes in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. Root: bırak\n2. Future tense: ecek (bırakacak)\n3. Ability mood: abil (bırakabilecek)\n4. Passive voice: ıl (bırakılabilecek)\n5. Third person plural: ler (bırakılabilecekler)\n6. Accusative case: i (bırakılabilecekleri)\n7.

The root word \"kucak\" means \"lap\" or \"embrace\" in English. We need to follow Turkish grammar rules, which typically involve adding suffixes in a certain order, such as making the word plural, then adding tense, case, etc.\n\n1. kucak + la = kucakla (embrace with)\n2. kucakla + ma = kucaklama (do not embrace)\n3. kucaklama + dık = kucaklamadık (we did not embrace)\n4. kucaklamadık + lar = kucaklamadıklar (those that we did not embrace)\n5. kucaklamadıklar + ın = kucaklamadıkların (of those that we did not embrace)\n6. kucaklamadıkların + ı = kucaklamadıklarını (those that you did not embrace - accusative case)\n\nNow we have a grammatically correct word in Turkish:\n\n<Answer>kucaklamadıklarını</Answer>\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- la\n- ma\n- dık\n- lar\n- ın\n- ı\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: kaygı\nAffixes: lar, ma, ı, ma, ın, lan\nAnswer: First, let's list the affixes provided:\n\n1. lar\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ı\n4. ma (second occurrence)\n5. ın\n6. lan\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\" to make it a verb: kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamanın\n6. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamanını\n7. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamanınlar\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the plural affix \"lar\" cannot be directly added to the possessive form in Turkish. The correct order should be:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\": kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamalar\n6. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamaların\n7. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamalarını\n\nThe correct word constructed by using each affix exactly once and in a grammatically correct order is <Answer>kaygılanmamalarını</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. lan\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ma (second occurrence)\n4. lar\n5. ın\n6. ı\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: sorgu\nAffixes: i, la, dik, ler, ni, yabil\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"sorgu\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar.\n\n1. \"sorgu\" (interrogation)\n2. \"sorgu\" + \"la\" = \"sorgula\" (interrogate)\n3. \"sorgula\" + \"yabil\" = \"sorgulayabil\" (can interrogate)\n4. \"sorgulayabil\" + \"dik\" = \"sorgulayabildik\" (we were able to interrogate)\n5. \"sorgulayabildik\" + \"i\" = \"sorgulayabildiği\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate)\n6. \"sorgulayabildiği\" + \"ni\" = \"sorgulayabildiğini\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate - accusative case, often used to indicate direct object of a verb)\n7. \"sorgulayabildiğini\" + \"ler\" = \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" (that they were able to interrogate - plural)\n\nThe final word is \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" and the affixes used are:\n\n- la\n- yabil\n- dik\n- i\n- ni\n- ler\n\n<Answer>sorgulayabildiklerini</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: dünya\nAffixes: ı, ki, nda, i, lar, ler\nAnswer:",

            "prompt": "You are given a word root and a list of affixes (separated by comma) in Turkish. Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given affixes to the root. Use each affix exactly once. After forming a word, list each affix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no affix is used more than once, confirm that all provided affixes are used, verify that no extra affixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: başar\nAffixes: ımız, a, ma, lar, la, dık\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"başar\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"başar\" (root) - to succeed\n2. \"başar + a\" - to be able to suceed\n3. \"başar + a + ma\" (negation) - not to succeed\n4. \"başar + a + ma + dık\" (past tense for negative) - we could not succeed\n5. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar\" (first person plural) - this is redundant since \"ımız\" already indicates first person plural, but in Turkish, sometimes double plural markers are used for emphasis or collective meaning\n6. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar + ımız\" (plural suffix) - the ones where we could not succeed\n7. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar + ımız + la\" (instrumental/comitative case) - with the ones where we could not succeed\n\nThe final constructed word is \"başaramadıklarımızla\".\n\n<Answer>başaramadıklarımızla</Answer>\n\nAffixes used in order:1. a\n2. ma\n3. dık\n4. lar\n5. ımız\n7. la\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: bırak\nAffixes: ecek, abil, ıl, ler, i, ni\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will start with the root \"bırak\" and then add the affixes in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. Root: bırak\n2. Future tense: ecek (bırakacak)\n3. Ability mood: abil (bırakabilecek)\n4. Passive voice: ıl (bırakılabilecek)\n5. Third person plural: ler (bırakılabilecekler)\n6. Accusative case: i (bırakılabilecekleri)\n7. Genitive case: ni (bırakılabileceklerini)\n\nNow, let's put them all together:\n\nbırak + abil + ecek + ıl + ler + i + ni = bırakılabileceklerini\n\nSo the final word is:\n\n<Answer>bırakılabileceklerini</Answer>\n\nAnd here is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- abil\n- ecek\n- ıl\n- ler\n- i\n- ni\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: kucak\nAffixes: lar, ın, ı, la, dık, ma\nAnswer: First, let's determine the order of the affixes to create a grammatically correct word in Turkish. The root word \"kucak\" means \"lap\" or \"embrace\" in English. We need to follow Turkish grammar rules, which typically involve adding suffixes in a certain order, such as making the word plural, then adding tense, case, etc.\n\n1. kucak + la = kucakla (embrace with)\n2. kucakla + ma = kucaklama (do not embrace)\n3. kucaklama + dık = kucaklamadık (we did not embrace)\n4. kucaklamadık + lar = kucaklamadıklar (those that we did not embrace)\n5. kucaklamadıklar + ın = kucaklamadıkların (of those that we did not embrace)\n6. kucaklamadıkların + ı = kucaklamadıklarını (those that you did not embrace - accusative case)\n\nNow we have a grammatically correct word in Turkish:\n\n<Answer>kucaklamadıklarını</Answer>\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n- la\n- ma\n- dık\n- lar\n- ın\n- ı\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: kaygı\nAffixes: lar, ma, ı, ma, ın, lan\nAnswer: First, let's list the affixes provided:\n\n1. lar\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ı\n4. ma (second occurrence)\n5. ın\n6. lan\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\" to make it a verb: kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamanın\n6. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamanını\n7. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamanınlar\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the plural affix \"lar\" cannot be directly added to the possessive form in Turkish. The correct order should be:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\": kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamalar\n6. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamaların\n7. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamalarını\n\nThe correct word constructed by using each affix exactly once and in a grammatically correct order is <Answer>kaygılanmamalarını</Answer>.\n\nHere is the list of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. lan\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ma (second occurrence)\n4. lar\n5. ın\n6. ı\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: sorgu\nAffixes: i, la, dik, ler, ni, yabil\nAnswer: To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"sorgu\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar.\n\n1. \"sorgu\" (interrogation)\n2. \"sorgu\" + \"la\" = \"sorgula\" (interrogate)\n3. \"sorgula\" + \"yabil\" = \"sorgulayabil\" (can interrogate)\n4. \"sorgulayabil\" + \"dik\" = \"sorgulayabildik\" (we were able to interrogate)\n5. \"sorgulayabildik\" + \"i\" = \"sorgulayabildiği\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate)\n6. \"sorgulayabildiği\" + \"ni\" = \"sorgulayabildiğini\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate - accusative case, often used to indicate direct object of a verb)\n7. \"sorgulayabildiğini\" + \"ler\" = \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" (that they were able to interrogate - plural)\n\nThe final word is \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" and the affixes used are:\n\n- la\n- yabil\n- dik\n- i\n- ni\n- ler\n\n<Answer>sorgulayabildiklerini</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: sıfır\nAffixes: dır, a, lan, ım, yacağ, ma\nAnswer:",
