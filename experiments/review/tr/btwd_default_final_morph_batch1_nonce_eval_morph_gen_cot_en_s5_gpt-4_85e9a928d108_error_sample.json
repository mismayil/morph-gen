Given novel root \"anak\" is defined to mean \"uzak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"uzak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to append the given affix to the root. In this case, we have the root \"uzak\" and the affix \"tan.\"\n\nThe affix \"tan\" can be used to form a noun in the ablative case, indicating \"from a distance\" or \"from afar.\"\n\nSo, by appending \"tan\" to \"uzak,\" we get \"uzaktan,\" which means \"from a distance\" or \"from afar.\"\n\nEach affix used in the construction of the word:\n- tan (ablative case suffix)\n\nNow we replace the root \"uzak\" in \"uzaktan\" with our novel root \"anak\" to get the final answer \"anaktan\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>anaktan</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: çasar\nDefinition: çasar means sar in Turkish.\nAffixes: ıl\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"çasar\" is defined to mean \"sar\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"sar\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to append the given affix to the root. In this case, we have the root \"sar\" and the affix \"ıl\".\n\nStep 1: Append the affix \"ıl\" to the root \"sar\" to form the word.\n\nThe resulting word is \"sarıl\" which means \"to hug\" in Turkish.\n\nAffix used:\n- ıl\n\nNow we replace the root \"sar\" in \"sarıl\" with our novel root \"çasar\" to get the final answer \"çasarıl\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>çasarıl</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: raru\nDefinition: raru means bu in Turkish.\nAffixes: ndan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"raru\" is defined to mean \"bu\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"bu\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish by appending the given affix to the root \"bu,\" we will follow the steps below:\n\n1. Identify the root: \"bu\"\n2. Identify the affix: \"ndan\"\n3. Append the affix to the root: \"bu\" + \"ndan\" = \"bundan\"\n\nNow, let's verify adherence to the rules:\n- The affix \"ndan\" is used exactly once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes outside the provided list are included.

Given novel root \"ciki\" is defined to mean \"yeni\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yeni\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish by appending the given affix to the root \"yeni\", we will follow the steps:\n\n1. Take the root \"yeni\".\n2. Append the affix \"len\" to the root.\n\nThe resulting word is \"yenilen\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n\n- \"len\" (makes the word mean \"to be renewed\" or \"to renew oneself\")\n\nWe have used the affix \"len\" exactly once, and there are no other affixes provided in the list. We have not included any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yeni\" in \"yenilen\" with our novel root \"ciki\" to get the final answer \"cikilen\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>cikilen</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: vısun\nDefinition: vısun means savun in Turkish.\nAffixes: uyor\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root.

To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to append the given affix to the root. In this case, we have the root \"sar\" and the affix \"ıl\".\n\nStep 1: Append the affix \"ıl\" to the root \"sar\" to form the word.\n\nThe resulting word is \"sarıl\" which means \"to hug\" in Turkish.\n\nAffix used:\n- ıl\n\nNow we replace the root \"sar\" in \"sarıl\" with our novel root \"çasar\" to get the final answer \"çasarıl\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>çasarıl</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: raru\nDefinition: raru means bu in Turkish.\nAffixes: ndan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"raru\" is defined to mean \"bu\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"bu\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish by appending the given affix to the root \"bu,\" we will follow the steps below:\n\n1. Identify the root: \"bu\"\n2. Identify the affix: \"ndan\"\n3. Append the affix to the root: \"bu\" + \"ndan\" = \"bundan\"\n\nNow, let's verify adherence to the rules:\n- The affix \"ndan\" is used exactly once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes outside the provided list are included. List of affixes used in the construction of the word:\n- ndan\n\nNow we replace the root \"bu\" in \"bundan\" with our novel root \"raru\" to get the final answer \"rarundan\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>rarundan</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: ciki\nDefinition: ciki means yeni in Turkish.\nAffixes: len\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"ciki\" is defined to mean \"yeni\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yeni\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish by appending the given affix to the root \"yeni\", we will follow the steps:\n\n1. Take the root \"yeni\".\n2. Append the affix \"len\" to the root.\n\nThe resulting word is \"yenilen\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n\n- \"len\" (makes the word mean \"to be renewed\" or \"to renew oneself\")\n\nWe have used the affix \"len\" exactly once, and there are no other affixes provided in the list. We have not included any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yeni\" in \"yenilen\" with our novel root \"ciki\" to get the final answer \"cikilen\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>cikilen</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: vısun\nDefinition: vısun means savun in Turkish.\nAffixes: uyor\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"vısun\" is defined to mean \"savun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"savun\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to append the given affix to the root. The root given is \"savun\" and the affix is \"uyor\". \n\nThe correct construction would be to attach the affix directly to the root without any changes since the root ends in a vowel and the affix starts with a vowel, and in Turkish, this is a permissible combination.\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"savunuyor\".\n\nAffix used: uyor\n\nNow we replace the root \"savun\" in \"savunuyor\" with our novel root \"vısun\" to get the final answer \"vısunuyor\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>vısunuyor</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: mıde\nDefinition: mıde means sade in Turkish.\nAffixes: ce\nAnswer:",

Given novel root \"doru\" is defined to mean \"kuru\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kuru\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"kuru\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"t\" is a past tense marker for verbs, but \"kuru\" is an adjective meaning \"dry\". In Turkish, to convert an adjective to a verb, you often use the affix \"-(I)r\" or \"-(I)l\" (with vowel harmony). However, since we don't have such an affix in the list, we can assume that \"kuru\" is being used as a verb root here, meaning \"to dry\". So we can directly add \"t\" to indicate past tense: \"kurut\" (he/she/it dried).\n\n2. \"muş\" is a suffix that is used to indicate hearsay or uncertainty about the past. It should be attached after the verb root has been put into the past tense: \"kurutmuş\" (he/she/it has apparently dried).\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<kuru> + <t> + <muş> = <kurutmuş>\n\nLet's verify adherence to the rules:\n- No affix is used more than once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes outside the provided list are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kuru\" in \"kurutmuş\" with our novel root \"doru\" to get the final answer \"dorutmuş\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dorutmuş</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: ledap\nDefinition: ledap means kitap in Turkish.\nAffixes: da, çı\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"ledap\" is defined to mean \"kitap\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kitap\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"kitap\" one by one, following Turkish grammar rules.\n\n1. \"kitap\" + \"çı\" = \"kitapçı\" (meaning \"bookshop\" or \"bookseller\")\n2. \"kitapçı\" + \"da\" = \"kitapçıda\" (meaning \"in the bookshop\")\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"çı\" (suffix that turns a noun into a person or place associated with that noun)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix, meaning \"in\" or \"at\")\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kitap\" in \"kitapçıda\" with our novel root \"ledap\" to get the final answer \"ledapçıda\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ledapçıda</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: yoyha\nDefinition: yoyha means parça in Turkish.\nAffixes: mış, lan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"yoyha\" is defined to mean \"parça\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"parça\" using the given affixes. First, we will append the affix \"lan\" to the root \"parça\" to create a verb form that means \"to become fragmented\" or \"to be divided into pieces\". Then, we will add the affix \"mış\" to indicate past tense, third person singular in the indicative mood, which also implies an evidential or hearsay past.\n\nStep 1: parça + lan = parçalan (to become fragmented)\nStep 2: parçalan + mış = parçalanmış (has/had become fragmented, it is said to have become fragmented)\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. lan\n2. mış\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"parça\" in \"parçalanmış\" with our novel root \"yoyha\" to get the final answer \"yoyhalanmış\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yoyhalanmış</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: latun\nDefinition: latun means sorun in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ım\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"latun\" is defined to mean \"sorun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"sorun\" using the given affixes. First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"sorun\" in a grammatically correct order. In Turkish, the plural affix \"lar\" is added to a noun to make it plural, and the possessive affix \"ım\" is added to indicate possession (in this case, first person singular - \"my\").\n\nStep 1: Add the plural affix \"lar\" to the root \"sorun\" to make it plural.\nResult: sorunlar\n\nStep 2: Add the possessive affix \"ım\" to the pluralized noun to indicate possession.\nResult: sorunlarım\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n1. lar (plural)\n2. ım (first person singular possessive)\n\nNow we replace the root \"sorun\" in \"sorunlarım\" with our novel root \"latun\" to get the final answer \"latunlarım\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>latunlarım</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: letühe\nDefinition: letühe means nitele in Turkish.\nAffixes: miş, n\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"letühe\" is defined to mean \"nitele\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"nitele\" using the given affixes. First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"nitele\" in a grammatically correct way in Turkish.\n\n1. The affix \"n\" is a passive voice marker for verbs in Turkish and is used after the root of the verb before tense or mood markers. So, we add \"n\" to \"nitele\" to get \"nitelen\".\n\n2. The affix \"miş\" is a past tense marker that indicates hearsay or uncertainty about the action. It is used after the verb root or after other affixes that modify the verb. So, we add \"miş\" after \"nitelen\" to get \"nitelenmiş\".\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<nitele> + <n> + <miş> = <nitelenmiş>\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. n - passive voice marker\n2. miş - past tense hearsay marker\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"nitele\" in \"nitelenmiş\" with our novel root \"letühe\" to get the final answer \"letühenmiş\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>letühenmiş</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: yova\nDefinition: yova means sıra in Turkish.\nAffixes: mış, dan\nAnswer:",

First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"arzu\" in a grammatically correct way in Turkish.\n\n1. The affix \"dan\" is an ablative case suffix, which can be used to indicate \"from\" in English. It is added directly to the noun: \"arzudan\" (from the desire).\n\n2. The affix \"muz\" is a first person plural possessive suffix in Turkish. It is used to indicate possession, in this case, \"our\". However, to use this possessive suffix correctly, we need to ensure that the noun is in the correct form to receive it. Since \"arzu\" ends in a vowel, we need a buffer consonant before adding the possessive suffix. In Turkish, this buffer is usually the letter \"m\". So, we add \"muz\" after inserting the buffer consonant to get \"arzumuz\" (our desire).\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n1. dan (ablative case suffix)\n2. muz (first person plural possessive suffix)\n\nNow we replace the root \"arzu\" in \"arzumuz\" with our novel root \"ıkbu\" to get the final answer \"ıkbuzumuz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ıkbuzumuz</Answer>",

Given novel root \"doru\" is defined to mean \"kuru\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kuru\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"kuru\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"t\" is a past tense marker for verbs, but \"kuru\" is an adjective meaning \"dry\". In Turkish, to convert an adjective to a verb, you often use the affix \"-(I)r\" or \"-(I)l\" (with vowel harmony). However, since we don't have such an affix in the list, we can assume that \"kuru\" is being used as a verb root here, meaning \"to dry\". So we can directly add \"t\" to indicate past tense: \"kurut\" (he/she/it dried).\n\n2. \"muş\" is a suffix that is used to indicate hearsay or uncertainty about the past. It should be attached after the verb root has been put into the past tense: \"kurutmuş\" (he/she/it has apparently dried).\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<kuru> + <t> + <muş> = <kurutmuş>\n\nLet's verify adherence to the rules:\n- No affix is used more than once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes outside the provided list are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kuru\" in \"kurutmuş\" with our novel root \"doru\" to get the final answer \"dorutmuş\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dorutmuş</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: ledap\nDefinition: ledap means kitap in Turkish.\nAffixes: da, çı\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"ledap\" is defined to mean \"kitap\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kitap\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"kitap\" one by one, following Turkish grammar rules.\n\n1. \"kitap\" + \"çı\" = \"kitapçı\" (meaning \"bookshop\" or \"bookseller\")\n2. \"kitapçı\" + \"da\" = \"kitapçıda\" (meaning \"in the bookshop\")\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"çı\" (suffix that turns a noun into a person or place associated with that noun)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix, meaning \"in\" or \"at\")\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kitap\" in \"kitapçıda\" with our novel root \"ledap\" to get the final answer \"ledapçıda\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ledapçıda</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: yoyha\nDefinition: yoyha means parça in Turkish.\nAffixes: mış, lan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"yoyha\" is defined to mean \"parça\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"parça\" using the given affixes. First, we will append the affix \"lan\" to the root \"parça\" to create a verb form that means \"to become fragmented\" or \"to be divided into pieces\". Then, we will add the affix \"mış\" to indicate past tense, third person singular in the indicative mood, which also implies an evidential or hearsay past.\n\nStep 1: parça + lan = parçalan (to become fragmented)\nStep 2: parçalan + mış = parçalanmış (has/had become fragmented, it is said to have become fragmented)\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. lan\n2. mış\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"parça\" in \"parçalanmış\" with our novel root \"yoyha\" to get the final answer \"yoyhalanmış\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yoyhalanmış</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: latun\nDefinition: latun means sorun in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ım\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"latun\" is defined to mean \"sorun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"sorun\" using the given affixes. First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"sorun\" in a grammatically correct order. In Turkish, the plural affix \"lar\" is added to a noun to make it plural, and the possessive affix \"ım\" is added to indicate possession (in this case, first person singular - \"my\").\n\nStep 1: Add the plural affix \"lar\" to the root \"sorun\" to make it plural.\nResult: sorunlar\n\nStep 2: Add the possessive affix \"ım\" to the pluralized noun to indicate possession.\nResult: sorunlarım\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n1. lar (plural)\n2. ım (first person singular possessive)\n\nNow we replace the root \"sorun\" in \"sorunlarım\" with our novel root \"latun\" to get the final answer \"latunlarım\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>latunlarım</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: letühe\nDefinition: letühe means nitele in Turkish.\nAffixes: miş, n\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root.

Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: doru\nDefinition: doru means kuru in Turkish.\nAffixes: t, muş\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"doru\" is defined to mean \"kuru\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kuru\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"kuru\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"t\" is a past tense marker for verbs, but \"kuru\" is an adjective meaning \"dry\". In Turkish, to convert an adjective to a verb, you often use the affix \"-(I)r\" or \"-(I)l\" (with vowel harmony). However, since we don't have such an affix in the list, we can assume that \"kuru\" is being used as a verb root here, meaning \"to dry\". So we can directly add \"t\" to indicate past tense: \"kurut\" (he/she/it dried).\n\n2. \"muş\" is a suffix that is used to indicate hearsay or uncertainty about the past. It should be attached after the verb root has been put into the past tense: \"kurutmuş\" (he/she/it has apparently dried).\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<kuru> + <t> + <muş> = <kurutmuş>\n\nLet's verify adherence to the rules:\n- No affix is used more than once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes outside the provided list are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kuru\" in \"kurutmuş\" with our novel root \"doru\" to get the final answer \"dorutmuş\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dorutmuş</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: ledap\nDefinition: ledap means kitap in Turkish.\nAffixes: da, çı\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"ledap\" is defined to mean \"kitap\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kitap\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"kitap\" one by one, following Turkish grammar rules.\n\n1. \"kitap\" + \"çı\" = \"kitapçı\" (meaning \"bookshop\" or \"bookseller\")\n2. \"kitapçı\" + \"da\" = \"kitapçıda\" (meaning \"in the bookshop\")\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"çı\" (suffix that turns a noun into a person or place associated with that noun)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix, meaning \"in\" or \"at\")\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kitap\" in \"kitapçıda\" with our novel root \"ledap\" to get the final answer \"ledapçıda\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ledapçıda</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: yoyha\nDefinition: yoyha means parça in Turkish.\nAffixes: mış, lan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"yoyha\" is defined to mean \"parça\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"parça\" using the given affixes. First, we will append the affix \"lan\" to the root \"parça\" to create a verb form that means \"to become fragmented\" or \"to be divided into pieces\". Then, we will add the affix \"mış\" to indicate past tense, third person singular in the indicative mood, which also implies an evidential or hearsay past.\n\nStep 1: parça + lan = parçalan (to become fragmented)\nStep 2: parçalan + mış = parçalanmış (has/had become fragmented, it is said to have become fragmented)\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. lan\n2. mış\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"parça\" in \"parçalanmış\" with our novel root \"yoyha\" to get the final answer \"yoyhalanmış\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yoyhalanmış</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: latun\nDefinition: latun means sorun in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ım\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"latun\" is defined to mean \"sorun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"sorun\" using the given affixes. First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"sorun\" in a grammatically correct order. In Turkish, the plural affix \"lar\" is added to a noun to make it plural, and the possessive affix \"ım\" is added to indicate possession (in this case, first person singular - \"my\").\n\nStep 1: Add the plural affix \"lar\" to the root \"sorun\" to make it plural.\nResult: sorunlar\n\nStep 2: Add the possessive affix \"ım\" to the pluralized noun to indicate possession.\nResult: sorunlarım\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n1. lar (plural)\n2. ım (first person singular possessive)\n\nNow we replace the root \"sorun\" in \"sorunlarım\" with our novel root \"latun\" to get the final answer \"latunlarım\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>latunlarım</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: letühe\nDefinition: letühe means nitele in Turkish.\nAffixes: miş, n\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"letühe\" is defined to mean \"nitele\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"nitele\" using the given affixes. First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"nitele\" in a grammatically correct way in Turkish.\n\n1. The affix \"n\" is a passive voice marker for verbs in Turkish and is used after the root of the verb before tense or mood markers. So, we add \"n\" to \"nitele\" to get \"nitelen\".\n\n2. The affix \"miş\" is a past tense marker that indicates hearsay or uncertainty about the action. It is used after the verb root or after other affixes that modify the verb. So, we add \"miş\" after \"nitelen\" to get \"nitelenmiş\".\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<nitele> + <n> + <miş> = <nitelenmiş>\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. n - passive voice marker\n2. miş - past tense hearsay marker\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"nitele\" in \"nitelenmiş\" with our novel root \"letühe\" to get the final answer \"letühenmiş\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>letühenmiş</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: ıçuş\nDefinition: ıçuş means oluş in Turkish.\nAffixes: umuz, un\nAnswer:",

First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"oluş\" in a grammatically correct way in Turkish.\n\n1. The affix \"un\" is a possessive marker in Turkish, indicating second person singular possession (your). However, \"oluş\" is a noun derived from the verb \"olmak\" (to happen/to occur), and it doesn't typically take a possessive marker directly. Instead, we would expect a possessive marker to be used with a noun that can be owned or possessed. Since we are given \"un\" and \"umuz\" (first person plural possessive - our), it seems we are meant to create a compound noun or a noun phrase where \"oluş\" is modified by another noun that can take a possessive marker.\n\n2. The affix \"umuz\" is the first person plural possessive marker (our). We can use this affix to indicate that the noun belongs to us.\n\nSince we cannot directly apply the possessive markers to \"oluş\" in a way that makes sense, we might need to think of a noun that can be derived from \"oluş\" and can take a possessive marker. One possibility is \"oluşum\" (formation/structure), which can then take the possessive marker \"umuz\" to become \"oluşumumuz\" (our formation/structure).\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<oluş> + <um> (to create \"oluşum\") + <uz> (to make it \"our\") = <oluşumuz>\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. um (to create the noun \"oluşum\" from \"oluş\")\n2. uz (first person plural possessive marker)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"oluş\" in \"oluşumuz\" with our novel root \"ıçuş\" to get the final answer \"ıçuşumuz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ıçuşumuz</Answer>",

First, we will append the affix \"lan\" to the root \"parça\" to create a verb form that means \"to become fragmented\" or \"to be divided into pieces\". Then, we will add the affix \"mış\" to indicate past tense, third person singular in the indicative mood, which also implies an evidential or hearsay past.\n\nStep 1: parça + lan = parçalan (to become fragmented)\nStep 2: parçalan + mış = parçalanmış (has/had become fragmented, it is said to have become fragmented)\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. lan\n2. mış\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"parça\" in \"parçalanmış\" with our novel root \"yoyha\" to get the final answer \"yoyhalanmış\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yoyhalanmış</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: latun\nDefinition: latun means sorun in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ım\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"latun\" is defined to mean \"sorun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"sorun\" using the given affixes. First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"sorun\" in a grammatically correct order. In Turkish, the plural affix \"lar\" is added to a noun to make it plural, and the possessive affix \"ım\" is added to indicate possession (in this case, first person singular - \"my\").\n\nStep 1: Add the plural affix \"lar\" to the root \"sorun\" to make it plural.\nResult: sorunlar\n\nStep 2: Add the possessive affix \"ım\" to the pluralized noun to indicate possession.\nResult: sorunlarım\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n1. lar (plural)\n2. ım (first person singular possessive)\n\nNow we replace the root \"sorun\" in \"sorunlarım\" with our novel root \"latun\" to get the final answer \"latunlarım\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>latunlarım</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: letühe\nDefinition: letühe means nitele in Turkish.\nAffixes: miş, n\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"letühe\" is defined to mean \"nitele\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"nitele\" using the given affixes. First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"nitele\" in a grammatically correct way in Turkish.\n\n1. The affix \"n\" is a passive voice marker for verbs in Turkish and is used after the root of the verb before tense or mood markers. So, we add \"n\" to \"nitele\" to get \"nitelen\".\n\n2. The affix \"miş\" is a past tense marker that indicates hearsay or uncertainty about the action. It is used after the verb root or after other affixes that modify the verb. So, we add \"miş\" after \"nitelen\" to get \"nitelenmiş\".\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<nitele> + <n> + <miş> = <nitelenmiş>\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. n - passive voice marker\n2. miş - past tense hearsay marker\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"nitele\" in \"nitelenmiş\" with our novel root \"letühe\" to get the final answer \"letühenmiş\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>letühenmiş</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: enidi\nDefinition: enidi means üzeri in Turkish.\nAffixes: ydi, ne\nAnswer:",

In Turkish, the plural affix \"lar\" is added to a noun to make it plural, and the possessive affix \"ım\" is added to indicate possession (in this case, first person singular - \"my\").\n\nStep 1: Add the plural affix \"lar\" to the root \"sorun\" to make it plural.\nResult: sorunlar\n\nStep 2: Add the possessive affix \"ım\" to the pluralized noun to indicate possession.\nResult: sorunlarım\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n1. lar (plural)\n2. ım (first person singular possessive)\n\nNow we replace the root \"sorun\" in \"sorunlarım\" with our novel root \"latun\" to get the final answer \"latunlarım\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>latunlarım</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: letühe\nDefinition: letühe means nitele in Turkish.\nAffixes: miş, n\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"letühe\" is defined to mean \"nitele\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"nitele\" using the given affixes. First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"nitele\" in a grammatically correct way in Turkish.\n\n1. The affix \"n\" is a passive voice marker for verbs in Turkish and is used after the root of the verb before tense or mood markers. So, we add \"n\" to \"nitele\" to get \"nitelen\".\n\n2. The affix \"miş\" is a past tense marker that indicates hearsay or uncertainty about the action. It is used after the verb root or after other affixes that modify the verb. So, we add \"miş\" after \"nitelen\" to get \"nitelenmiş\".\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<nitele> + <n> + <miş> = <nitelenmiş>\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. n - passive voice marker\n2. miş - past tense hearsay marker\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"nitele\" in \"nitelenmiş\" with our novel root \"letühe\" to get the final answer \"letühenmiş\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>letühenmiş</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: eyaj\nDefinition: eyaj means imaj in Turkish.\nAffixes: ı, ınız\nAnswer:",

The affix \"ınız\" is also a possessive marker, but it indicates second person plural possession (your). However, it cannot be directly added to the root \"imaj\" because it needs to be attached to a noun that is already in the possessive form.

Given novel root \"doru\" is defined to mean \"kuru\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kuru\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"kuru\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"t\" is a past tense marker for verbs, but \"kuru\" is an adjective meaning \"dry\". In Turkish, to convert an adjective to a verb, you often use the affix \"-(I)r\" or \"-(I)l\" (with vowel harmony). However, since we don't have such an affix in the list, we can assume that \"kuru\" is being used as a verb root here, meaning \"to dry\". So we can directly add \"t\" to indicate past tense: \"kurut\" (he/she/it dried).\n\n2. \"muş\" is a suffix that is used to indicate hearsay or uncertainty about the past. It should be attached after the verb root has been put into the past tense: \"kurutmuş\" (he/she/it has apparently dried).\n\nNow, let's put the word together:\n\n<kuru> + <t> + <muş> = <kurutmuş>\n\nLet's verify adherence to the rules:\n- No affix is used more than once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes outside the provided list are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kuru\" in \"kurutmuş\" with our novel root \"doru\" to get the final answer \"dorutmuş\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dorutmuş</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: ledap\nDefinition: ledap means kitap in Turkish.\nAffixes: da, çı\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"ledap\" is defined to mean \"kitap\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kitap\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"kitap\" one by one, following Turkish grammar rules.\n\n1. \"kitap\" + \"çı\" = \"kitapçı\" (meaning \"bookshop\" or \"bookseller\")\n2. \"kitapçı\" + \"da\" = \"kitapçıda\" (meaning \"in the bookshop\")\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"çı\" (suffix that turns a noun into a person or place associated with that noun)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix, meaning \"in\" or \"at\")\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kitap\" in \"kitapçıda\" with our novel root \"ledap\" to get the final answer \"ledapçıda\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ledapçıda</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: yoyha\nDefinition: yoyha means parça in Turkish.\nAffixes: mış, lan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"yoyha\" is defined to mean \"parça\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"parça\" using the given affixes. First, we will append the affix \"lan\" to the root \"parça\" to create a verb form that means \"to become fragmented\" or \"to be divided into pieces\". Then, we will add the affix \"mış\" to indicate past tense, third person singular in the indicative mood, which also implies an evidential or hearsay past.\n\nStep 1: parça + lan = parçalan (to become fragmented)\nStep 2: parçalan + mış = parçalanmış (has/had become fragmented, it is said to have become fragmented)\n\nAffixes used in order:\n1. lan\n2. mış\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"parça\" in \"parçalanmış\" with our novel root \"yoyha\" to get the final answer \"yoyhalanmış\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yoyhalanmış</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: latun\nDefinition: latun means sorun in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ım\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root.

First, we need to append the affixes to the root \"mücadele\" in a grammatically correct way in Turkish.\n\n1. The affix \"di\" is a past tense marker for verbs. However, \"mücadele\" is a noun meaning \"struggle\" or \"fight\". To use the past tense marker, we need to convert the noun into a verb. In Turkish, the noun \"mücadele\" can be used as a verb without any additional affixes, so we can directly add \"di\" to indicate past tense: \"mücadeledi\" (he/she/it struggled).\n\n2. The affix \"miz\" is a possessive suffix that indicates first person plural possession (our). However, since \"mücadeledi\" is a verb in past tense, we cannot directly add a possessive suffix to it.

Given novel root \"dotıf\" is defined to mean \"zayıf\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"zayıf\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"zayıf\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"lık\" is a noun-forming suffix that can be used to create a noun from an adjective. It often denotes a state or quality. So, we add \"lık\" to \"zayıf\" to form \"zayıflık\" which means \"weakness\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix. When added to \"zayıflık\", it pluralizes the noun, resulting in \"zayıflıklar\" which means \"weaknesses\".\n3. \"ı\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular. It should be attached to a noun to indicate possession. In this case, we add \"ı\" to \"zayıflıklar\" to form \"zayıflıkları\" which means \"his/her/its weaknesses\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"lık\" to form \"zayıflık\"\n- \"lar\" to form \"zayıflıklar\"\n- \"ı\" to form \"zayıflıkları\"\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"zayıf\" in \"zayıflıkları\" with our novel root \"dotıf\" to get the final answer \"dotıflıkları\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dotıflıkları</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: arun\nDefinition: arun means uzun in Turkish.\nAffixes: luğ, a, un\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"arun\" is defined to mean \"uzun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"uzun\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to append the affixes to the root \"uzun\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish morphology. The order of affixes is important in Turkish, as it can change the meaning of the word. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"luğ\" is a nominalizing suffix that can turn adjectives or nouns into abstract nouns.\n2. \"a\" is a dative case suffix, indicating direction towards something or someone.\n3. \"un\" is a possessive suffix for third person singular (his/her/its).\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. Start with the root \"uzun\" (which means \"long\").\n2. Add the suffix \"luğ\" to create \"uzunluk\" (meaning \"length\").\n3. Add the suffix \"a\" to form \"uzunluğa\" (meaning \"to the length\").\n4. Finally, add the suffix \"un\" to get \"uzunluğuna\" (meaning \"to his/her/its length\").\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"uzun\" in \"uzunluğuna\" with our novel root \"arun\" to get the final answer \"arunluğuna\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>arunluğuna</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: kıkın\nDefinition: kıkın means yakın in Turkish.\nAffixes: laş, tık, ça\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"kıkın\" is defined to mean \"yakın\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yakın\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"yakın\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. yakın + laş = yakınlaş (to become close)\n2. yakınlaş + tık = yakınlaştık (we became close)\n3. yakınlaştık + ça = yakınlaştıkça (as we become close)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. laş\n2. tık\n3. ça\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yakın\" in \"yakınlaştıkça\" with our novel root \"kıkın\" to get the final answer \"kıkınlaştıkça\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>kıkınlaştıkça</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: nebü\nDefinition: nebü means büyü in Turkish.\nAffixes: çesine, miş, len\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"nebü\" is defined to mean \"büyü\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"büyü\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"büyü\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"len\" is a passive or reflexive suffix that can be added directly to the root to make it an adjective or to give a meaning that the action is done to the subject itself. So we get \"büyülen\".\n\n2. \"miş\" is a suffix used to indicate hearsay or past experience that the speaker did not directly witness. It is often used after a verb, so we can add it to \"büyülen\" to create a verb in the past tense that implies hearsay. We get \"büyülenmiş\".\n\n3. \"çesine\" is a suffix that is used to indicate a manner or way of doing something, similar to the English \"-like\" or \"-as if\". It is added to the end of the word. So we add it to \"büyülenmiş\" to get \"büyülenmişçesine\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\nRoot: büyü\nAffixes: len, miş, çesine\nConstructed word: büyülenmişçesine\n\nTo verify adherence to the rules:\n- Each affix is used exactly once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"büyü\" in \"büyülenmişçesine\" with our novel root \"nebü\" to get the final answer \"nebülenmişçesine\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nebülenmişçesine</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: mıymet\nDefinition: mıymet means farket in Turkish.\nAffixes: me, se, k\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mıymet\" is defined to mean \"farket\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"farket\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the root given:\n\nRoot: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\n\nIn Turkish, the affix \"me\" is a negation suffix for verbs, \"se\" is a conditional suffix, and \"k\" is a past tense suffix for verbs in the narrative (rarely used) or as a necessity mood marker.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be:\n1. \"me\" to negate the verb,\n2. \"se\" to turn it into a conditional mood,\n3. \"k\" to indicate past tense or necessity.\n\nSo, the constructed word would be \"farketmese\" (if it had not been noticed), but since we have the \"k\" affix, which doesn't fit well after \"se\" in this context, we might need to reconsider the order or the use of \"k\". The \"k\" suffix is not commonly used in modern Turkish and might be a typo or a mistake. If we ignore the \"k\" and just use \"me\" and \"se\", we get \"farketmese\" which is a grammatically correct word.\n\nHowever, if we are to use all affixes, the \"k\" would typically come before \"se\" to form a word that is grammatically correct but not commonly used in modern Turkish. The word would be \"farketmekse\" (if it is to be noticed/noticed), but this construction is highly unusual and not standard.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal of using all affixes once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"farket\" in \"farketmekse\" with our novel root \"mıymet\" to get the final answer \"mıymetmekse\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mıymetmekse</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: levü\nDefinition: levü means büyü in Turkish.\nAffixes: leri, nde, dük\nAnswer:",

First, let's append the affixes to the root \"büyü\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"leri\" is a plural possessive suffix for the third person. It is used to indicate that something belongs to them. So, we add \"leri\" to \"büyü\" to form \"büyüleri\" which means \"their magic/spells\".\n2. \"nde\" is a locative case suffix. When added to \"büyüleri\", it indicates a location, resulting in \"büyülerinde\" which means \"in their magic/spells\".\n3. \"dük\" is a past tense suffix for the first person plural. However, it cannot be directly added to \"büyülerinde\" as it is not a verb. We need to find a verb form to attach it to. The verb form of \"büyü\" would be \"büyülemek\" (to cast a spell). If we were to use \"dük\" with \"büyülemek\", we would get \"büyüledük\" (we cast a spell). However, since we need to use \"nde\" and \"leri\" as well, we would need to form a noun that can take these suffixes and still make sense with \"dük\".\n\nConsidering the provided affixes and the rules of Turkish grammar, it seems there might be a challenge in forming a word that uses all the affixes in a way that is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. The affix \"dük\" typically follows a verb root to indicate past tense for the first person plural, but \"büyü\" is a noun, and \"nde\" and \"leri\" are affixes that modify nouns, not verbs.\n\nGiven this, we might need to reconsider the use of \"dük\" or assume that there is a verb form of \"levü\" that we can use. If we assume \"levülemek\" is the verb form (to cast a spell), we could then use \"dük\" to form \"levüledük\" (we cast a spell). However, this still does not allow us to use \"nde\" and \"leri\" in a grammatically correct way.\n\nSince the task requires using each affix exactly once and no extra affixes, and given the constraints, it seems that there is no way to construct a grammatically correct word using all the provided affixes with the root \"levü\" as defined. Therefore, it appears that there is an error in the provided affixes or the task as stated is not possible to complete as instructed.\n\nFinal answer: It is not possible to construct a grammatically correct word using all the provided affixes with the root \"levü\" as defined.",

Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: dotıf\nDefinition: dotıf means zayıf in Turkish.\nAffixes: lık, ı, lar\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dotıf\" is defined to mean \"zayıf\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"zayıf\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"zayıf\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"lık\" is a noun-forming suffix that can be used to create a noun from an adjective. It often denotes a state or quality. So, we add \"lık\" to \"zayıf\" to form \"zayıflık\" which means \"weakness\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix. When added to \"zayıflık\", it pluralizes the noun, resulting in \"zayıflıklar\" which means \"weaknesses\".\n3. \"ı\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular. It should be attached to a noun to indicate possession. In this case, we add \"ı\" to \"zayıflıklar\" to form \"zayıflıkları\" which means \"his/her/its weaknesses\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"lık\" to form \"zayıflık\"\n- \"lar\" to form \"zayıflıklar\"\n- \"ı\" to form \"zayıflıkları\"\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"zayıf\" in \"zayıflıkları\" with our novel root \"dotıf\" to get the final answer \"dotıflıkları\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dotıflıkları</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: arun\nDefinition: arun means uzun in Turkish.\nAffixes: luğ, a, un\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"arun\" is defined to mean \"uzun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"uzun\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to append the affixes to the root \"uzun\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish morphology. The order of affixes is important in Turkish, as it can change the meaning of the word. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"luğ\" is a nominalizing suffix that can turn adjectives or nouns into abstract nouns.\n2. \"a\" is a dative case suffix, indicating direction towards something or someone.\n3. \"un\" is a possessive suffix for third person singular (his/her/its).\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. Start with the root \"uzun\" (which means \"long\").\n2. Add the suffix \"luğ\" to create \"uzunluk\" (meaning \"length\").\n3. Add the suffix \"a\" to form \"uzunluğa\" (meaning \"to the length\").\n4. Finally, add the suffix \"un\" to get \"uzunluğuna\" (meaning \"to his/her/its length\").\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"uzun\" in \"uzunluğuna\" with our novel root \"arun\" to get the final answer \"arunluğuna\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>arunluğuna</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: kıkın\nDefinition: kıkın means yakın in Turkish.\nAffixes: laş, tık, ça\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"kıkın\" is defined to mean \"yakın\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yakın\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"yakın\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. yakın + laş = yakınlaş (to become close)\n2. yakınlaş + tık = yakınlaştık (we became close)\n3. yakınlaştık + ça = yakınlaştıkça (as we become close)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. laş\n2. tık\n3. ça\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yakın\" in \"yakınlaştıkça\" with our novel root \"kıkın\" to get the final answer \"kıkınlaştıkça\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>kıkınlaştıkça</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: nebü\nDefinition: nebü means büyü in Turkish.\nAffixes: çesine, miş, len\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"nebü\" is defined to mean \"büyü\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"büyü\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"büyü\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"len\" is a passive or reflexive suffix that can be added directly to the root to make it an adjective or to give a meaning that the action is done to the subject itself. So we get \"büyülen\".\n\n2. \"miş\" is a suffix used to indicate hearsay or past experience that the speaker did not directly witness. It is often used after a verb, so we can add it to \"büyülen\" to create a verb in the past tense that implies hearsay. We get \"büyülenmiş\".\n\n3. \"çesine\" is a suffix that is used to indicate a manner or way of doing something, similar to the English \"-like\" or \"-as if\". It is added to the end of the word. So we add it to \"büyülenmiş\" to get \"büyülenmişçesine\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\nRoot: büyü\nAffixes: len, miş, çesine\nConstructed word: büyülenmişçesine\n\nTo verify adherence to the rules:\n- Each affix is used exactly once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"büyü\" in \"büyülenmişçesine\" with our novel root \"nebü\" to get the final answer \"nebülenmişçesine\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nebülenmişçesine</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: mıymet\nDefinition: mıymet means farket in Turkish.\nAffixes: me, se, k\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mıymet\" is defined to mean \"farket\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"farket\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the root given:\n\nRoot: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\n\nIn Turkish, the affix \"me\" is a negation suffix for verbs, \"se\" is a conditional suffix, and \"k\" is a past tense suffix for verbs in the narrative (rarely used) or as a necessity mood marker.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be:\n1. \"me\" to negate the verb,\n2. \"se\" to turn it into a conditional mood,\n3. \"k\" to indicate past tense or necessity.\n\nSo, the constructed word would be \"farketmese\" (if it had not been noticed), but since we have the \"k\" affix, which doesn't fit well after \"se\" in this context, we might need to reconsider the order or the use of \"k\". The \"k\" suffix is not commonly used in modern Turkish and might be a typo or a mistake. If we ignore the \"k\" and just use \"me\" and \"se\", we get \"farketmese\" which is a grammatically correct word.\n\nHowever, if we are to use all affixes, the \"k\" would typically come before \"se\" to form a word that is grammatically correct but not commonly used in modern Turkish. The word would be \"farketmekse\" (if it is to be noticed/noticed), but this construction is highly unusual and not standard.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal of using all affixes once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"farket\" in \"farketmekse\" with our novel root \"mıymet\" to get the final answer \"mıymetmekse\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mıymetmekse</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: ıga\nDefinition: ıga means ara in Turkish.\nAffixes: dır, nda, sı\nAnswer:",

Given novel root \"kekşelet\" is defined to mean \"cinsiyet\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"cinsiyet\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"cinsiyet\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"liğ\" is a noun-forming suffix that can be used to create a noun from another noun or adjective. It often denotes a state or quality. So, we add \"liğ\" to \"cinsiyet\" to form \"cinsiyetliğ\" which is not a standard word but would mean \"the state of having a gender\" if it were used.\n2. \"çi\" is a suffix used to indicate a profession or an occupation related to the root word. When added to \"cinsiyetliğ\", it would create \"cinsiyetliğçi\", which is not a standard word and does not make sense in Turkish as \"cinsiyetliğ\" is not a valid root for this suffix.\n3. \"i\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular. It should be attached to a noun to indicate possession. In this case, we add \"i\" to \"cinsiyetliğçi\" to form \"cinsiyetliğçii\" which is again not a standard word and does not make sense in Turkish.\n\nHowever, since the task is to use all the affixes once and create a grammatically correct word, we need to reconsider the order and the application of the affixes. The correct grammatical structure in Turkish would be:\n\n1. \"liğ\" to form a noun from the root word.\n2. \"i\" to indicate possession.\n3. \"çi\" to indicate a profession or an occupation.\n\nSo, the constructed word would be \"cinsiyetliği\" (his/her/its gender) and then adding \"çi\" to form \"cinsiyetliğiçi\" which is not a standard word but follows the rules given for the exercise.\n\nNow we replace the root \"cinsiyet\" in \"cinsiyetliğiçi\" with our novel root \"kekşelet\" to get the final answer \"kekşeletliğiçi\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>kekşeletliğiçi</Answer>",

Check the following: Ensure no affix is used more than once, confirm that all provided affixes are used, verify that no extra affixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: dotıf\nDefinition: dotıf means zayıf in Turkish.\nAffixes: lık, ı, lar\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dotıf\" is defined to mean \"zayıf\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"zayıf\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"zayıf\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"lık\" is a noun-forming suffix that can be used to create a noun from an adjective. It often denotes a state or quality. So, we add \"lık\" to \"zayıf\" to form \"zayıflık\" which means \"weakness\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix. When added to \"zayıflık\", it pluralizes the noun, resulting in \"zayıflıklar\" which means \"weaknesses\".\n3. \"ı\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular. It should be attached to a noun to indicate possession. In this case, we add \"ı\" to \"zayıflıklar\" to form \"zayıflıkları\" which means \"his/her/its weaknesses\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"lık\" to form \"zayıflık\"\n- \"lar\" to form \"zayıflıklar\"\n- \"ı\" to form \"zayıflıkları\"\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"zayıf\" in \"zayıflıkları\" with our novel root \"dotıf\" to get the final answer \"dotıflıkları\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dotıflıkları</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: arun\nDefinition: arun means uzun in Turkish.\nAffixes: luğ, a, un\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"arun\" is defined to mean \"uzun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"uzun\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to append the affixes to the root \"uzun\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish morphology. The order of affixes is important in Turkish, as it can change the meaning of the word. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"luğ\" is a nominalizing suffix that can turn adjectives or nouns into abstract nouns.\n2. \"a\" is a dative case suffix, indicating direction towards something or someone.\n3. \"un\" is a possessive suffix for third person singular (his/her/its).\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. Start with the root \"uzun\" (which means \"long\").\n2. Add the suffix \"luğ\" to create \"uzunluk\" (meaning \"length\").\n3. Add the suffix \"a\" to form \"uzunluğa\" (meaning \"to the length\").\n4. Finally, add the suffix \"un\" to get \"uzunluğuna\" (meaning \"to his/her/its length\").\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"uzun\" in \"uzunluğuna\" with our novel root \"arun\" to get the final answer \"arunluğuna\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>arunluğuna</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: kıkın\nDefinition: kıkın means yakın in Turkish.\nAffixes: laş, tık, ça\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"kıkın\" is defined to mean \"yakın\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yakın\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"yakın\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. yakın + laş = yakınlaş (to become close)\n2. yakınlaş + tık = yakınlaştık (we became close)\n3. yakınlaştık + ça = yakınlaştıkça (as we become close)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. laş\n2. tık\n3. ça\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yakın\" in \"yakınlaştıkça\" with our novel root \"kıkın\" to get the final answer \"kıkınlaştıkça\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>kıkınlaştıkça</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: nebü\nDefinition: nebü means büyü in Turkish.\nAffixes: çesine, miş, len\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"nebü\" is defined to mean \"büyü\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"büyü\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"büyü\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"len\" is a passive or reflexive suffix that can be added directly to the root to make it an adjective or to give a meaning that the action is done to the subject itself. So we get \"büyülen\".\n\n2. \"miş\" is a suffix used to indicate hearsay or past experience that the speaker did not directly witness. It is often used after a verb, so we can add it to \"büyülen\" to create a verb in the past tense that implies hearsay. We get \"büyülenmiş\".\n\n3. \"çesine\" is a suffix that is used to indicate a manner or way of doing something, similar to the English \"-like\" or \"-as if\". It is added to the end of the word. So we add it to \"büyülenmiş\" to get \"büyülenmişçesine\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\nRoot: büyü\nAffixes: len, miş, çesine\nConstructed word: büyülenmişçesine\n\nTo verify adherence to the rules:\n- Each affix is used exactly once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"büyü\" in \"büyülenmişçesine\" with our novel root \"nebü\" to get the final answer \"nebülenmişçesine\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nebülenmişçesine</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: mıymet\nDefinition: mıymet means farket in Turkish.\nAffixes: me, se, k\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mıymet\" is defined to mean \"farket\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"farket\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the root given:\n\nRoot: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\n\nIn Turkish, the affix \"me\" is a negation suffix for verbs, \"se\" is a conditional suffix, and \"k\" is a past tense suffix for verbs in the narrative (rarely used) or as a necessity mood marker.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be:\n1. \"me\" to negate the verb,\n2. \"se\" to turn it into a conditional mood,\n3. \"k\" to indicate past tense or necessity.\n\nSo, the constructed word would be \"farketmese\" (if it had not been noticed), but since we have the \"k\" affix, which doesn't fit well after \"se\" in this context, we might need to reconsider the order or the use of \"k\". The \"k\" suffix is not commonly used in modern Turkish and might be a typo or a mistake. If we ignore the \"k\" and just use \"me\" and \"se\", we get \"farketmese\" which is a grammatically correct word.\n\nHowever, if we are to use all affixes, the \"k\" would typically come before \"se\" to form a word that is grammatically correct but not commonly used in modern Turkish. The word would be \"farketmekse\" (if it is to be noticed/noticed), but this construction is highly unusual and not standard.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal of using all affixes once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"farket\" in \"farketmekse\" with our novel root \"mıymet\" to get the final answer \"mıymetmekse\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mıymetmekse</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: minen\nDefinition: minen means neden in Turkish.\nAffixes: le, lik, sel\nAnswer:",

Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given affixes to the root. Use each affix exactly once. After forming a word, list each affix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no affix is used more than once, confirm that all provided affixes are used, verify that no extra affixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: dotıf\nDefinition: dotıf means zayıf in Turkish.\nAffixes: lık, ı, lar\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dotıf\" is defined to mean \"zayıf\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"zayıf\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"zayıf\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"lık\" is a noun-forming suffix that can be used to create a noun from an adjective. It often denotes a state or quality. So, we add \"lık\" to \"zayıf\" to form \"zayıflık\" which means \"weakness\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix. When added to \"zayıflık\", it pluralizes the noun, resulting in \"zayıflıklar\" which means \"weaknesses\".\n3. \"ı\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular. It should be attached to a noun to indicate possession. In this case, we add \"ı\" to \"zayıflıklar\" to form \"zayıflıkları\" which means \"his/her/its weaknesses\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"lık\" to form \"zayıflık\"\n- \"lar\" to form \"zayıflıklar\"\n- \"ı\" to form \"zayıflıkları\"\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"zayıf\" in \"zayıflıkları\" with our novel root \"dotıf\" to get the final answer \"dotıflıkları\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dotıflıkları</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: arun\nDefinition: arun means uzun in Turkish.\nAffixes: luğ, a, un\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"arun\" is defined to mean \"uzun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"uzun\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to append the affixes to the root \"uzun\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish morphology. The order of affixes is important in Turkish, as it can change the meaning of the word. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"luğ\" is a nominalizing suffix that can turn adjectives or nouns into abstract nouns.\n2. \"a\" is a dative case suffix, indicating direction towards something or someone.\n3. \"un\" is a possessive suffix for third person singular (his/her/its).\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. Start with the root \"uzun\" (which means \"long\").\n2. Add the suffix \"luğ\" to create \"uzunluk\" (meaning \"length\").\n3. Add the suffix \"a\" to form \"uzunluğa\" (meaning \"to the length\").\n4. Finally, add the suffix \"un\" to get \"uzunluğuna\" (meaning \"to his/her/its length\").\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"uzun\" in \"uzunluğuna\" with our novel root \"arun\" to get the final answer \"arunluğuna\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>arunluğuna</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: kıkın\nDefinition: kıkın means yakın in Turkish.\nAffixes: laş, tık, ça\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"kıkın\" is defined to mean \"yakın\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yakın\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"yakın\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. yakın + laş = yakınlaş (to become close)\n2. yakınlaş + tık = yakınlaştık (we became close)\n3. yakınlaştık + ça = yakınlaştıkça (as we become close)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. laş\n2. tık\n3. ça\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yakın\" in \"yakınlaştıkça\" with our novel root \"kıkın\" to get the final answer \"kıkınlaştıkça\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>kıkınlaştıkça</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: nebü\nDefinition: nebü means büyü in Turkish.\nAffixes: çesine, miş, len\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"nebü\" is defined to mean \"büyü\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"büyü\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"büyü\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"len\" is a passive or reflexive suffix that can be added directly to the root to make it an adjective or to give a meaning that the action is done to the subject itself. So we get \"büyülen\".\n\n2. \"miş\" is a suffix used to indicate hearsay or past experience that the speaker did not directly witness. It is often used after a verb, so we can add it to \"büyülen\" to create a verb in the past tense that implies hearsay. We get \"büyülenmiş\".\n\n3. \"çesine\" is a suffix that is used to indicate a manner or way of doing something, similar to the English \"-like\" or \"-as if\". It is added to the end of the word. So we add it to \"büyülenmiş\" to get \"büyülenmişçesine\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\nRoot: büyü\nAffixes: len, miş, çesine\nConstructed word: büyülenmişçesine\n\nTo verify adherence to the rules:\n- Each affix is used exactly once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"büyü\" in \"büyülenmişçesine\" with our novel root \"nebü\" to get the final answer \"nebülenmişçesine\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nebülenmişçesine</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: mıymet\nDefinition: mıymet means farket in Turkish.\nAffixes: me, se, k\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mıymet\" is defined to mean \"farket\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"farket\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the root given:\n\nRoot: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\n\nIn Turkish, the affix \"me\" is a negation suffix for verbs, \"se\" is a conditional suffix, and \"k\" is a past tense suffix for verbs in the narrative (rarely used) or as a necessity mood marker.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be:\n1. \"me\" to negate the verb,\n2. \"se\" to turn it into a conditional mood,\n3. \"k\" to indicate past tense or necessity.\n\nSo, the constructed word would be \"farketmese\" (if it had not been noticed), but since we have the \"k\" affix, which doesn't fit well after \"se\" in this context, we might need to reconsider the order or the use of \"k\". The \"k\" suffix is not commonly used in modern Turkish and might be a typo or a mistake. If we ignore the \"k\" and just use \"me\" and \"se\", we get \"farketmese\" which is a grammatically correct word.\n\nHowever, if we are to use all affixes, the \"k\" would typically come before \"se\" to form a word that is grammatically correct but not commonly used in modern Turkish. The word would be \"farketmekse\" (if it is to be noticed/noticed), but this construction is highly unusual and not standard.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal of using all affixes once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"farket\" in \"farketmekse\" with our novel root \"mıymet\" to get the final answer \"mıymetmekse\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mıymetmekse</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: ubun\nDefinition: ubun means onun in Turkish.\nAffixes: e, ler, ki\nAnswer:",

In this case, we add \"ı\" to \"zayıflıklar\" to form \"zayıflıkları\" which means \"his/her/its weaknesses\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"lık\" to form \"zayıflık\"\n- \"lar\" to form \"zayıflıklar\"\n- \"ı\" to form \"zayıflıkları\"\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"zayıf\" in \"zayıflıkları\" with our novel root \"dotıf\" to get the final answer \"dotıflıkları\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dotıflıkları</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: arun\nDefinition: arun means uzun in Turkish.\nAffixes: luğ, a, un\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"arun\" is defined to mean \"uzun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"uzun\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to append the affixes to the root \"uzun\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish morphology. The order of affixes is important in Turkish, as it can change the meaning of the word. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"luğ\" is a nominalizing suffix that can turn adjectives or nouns into abstract nouns.\n2. \"a\" is a dative case suffix, indicating direction towards something or someone.\n3. \"un\" is a possessive suffix for third person singular (his/her/its).\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. Start with the root \"uzun\" (which means \"long\").\n2. Add the suffix \"luğ\" to create \"uzunluk\" (meaning \"length\").\n3. Add the suffix \"a\" to form \"uzunluğa\" (meaning \"to the length\").\n4. Finally, add the suffix \"un\" to get \"uzunluğuna\" (meaning \"to his/her/its length\").\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"uzun\" in \"uzunluğuna\" with our novel root \"arun\" to get the final answer \"arunluğuna\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>arunluğuna</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: kıkın\nDefinition: kıkın means yakın in Turkish.\nAffixes: laş, tık, ça\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"kıkın\" is defined to mean \"yakın\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yakın\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"yakın\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. yakın + laş = yakınlaş (to become close)\n2. yakınlaş + tık = yakınlaştık (we became close)\n3. yakınlaştık + ça = yakınlaştıkça (as we become close)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. laş\n2. tık\n3. ça\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yakın\" in \"yakınlaştıkça\" with our novel root \"kıkın\" to get the final answer \"kıkınlaştıkça\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>kıkınlaştıkça</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: nebü\nDefinition: nebü means büyü in Turkish.\nAffixes: çesine, miş, len\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"nebü\" is defined to mean \"büyü\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"büyü\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"büyü\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"len\" is a passive or reflexive suffix that can be added directly to the root to make it an adjective or to give a meaning that the action is done to the subject itself. So we get \"büyülen\".\n\n2. \"miş\" is a suffix used to indicate hearsay or past experience that the speaker did not directly witness. It is often used after a verb, so we can add it to \"büyülen\" to create a verb in the past tense that implies hearsay. We get \"büyülenmiş\".\n\n3. \"çesine\" is a suffix that is used to indicate a manner or way of doing something, similar to the English \"-like\" or \"-as if\". It is added to the end of the word. So we add it to \"büyülenmiş\" to get \"büyülenmişçesine\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\nRoot: büyü\nAffixes: len, miş, çesine\nConstructed word: büyülenmişçesine\n\nTo verify adherence to the rules:\n- Each affix is used exactly once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"büyü\" in \"büyülenmişçesine\" with our novel root \"nebü\" to get the final answer \"nebülenmişçesine\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nebülenmişçesine</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: mıymet\nDefinition: mıymet means farket in Turkish.\nAffixes: me, se, k\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mıymet\" is defined to mean \"farket\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"farket\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the root given:\n\nRoot: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\n\nIn Turkish, the affix \"me\" is a negation suffix for verbs, \"se\" is a conditional suffix, and \"k\" is a past tense suffix for verbs in the narrative (rarely used) or as a necessity mood marker.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be:\n1. \"me\" to negate the verb,\n2. \"se\" to turn it into a conditional mood,\n3. \"k\" to indicate past tense or necessity.\n\nSo, the constructed word would be \"farketmese\" (if it had not been noticed), but since we have the \"k\" affix, which doesn't fit well after \"se\" in this context, we might need to reconsider the order or the use of \"k\". The \"k\" suffix is not commonly used in modern Turkish and might be a typo or a mistake. If we ignore the \"k\" and just use \"me\" and \"se\", we get \"farketmese\" which is a grammatically correct word.\n\nHowever, if we are to use all affixes, the \"k\" would typically come before \"se\" to form a word that is grammatically correct but not commonly used in modern Turkish. The word would be \"farketmekse\" (if it is to be noticed/noticed), but this construction is highly unusual and not standard.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal of using all affixes once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"farket\" in \"farketmekse\" with our novel root \"mıymet\" to get the final answer \"mıymetmekse\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mıymetmekse</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: ubıl\nDefinition: ubıl means akıl in Turkish.\nAffixes: dı, lan, m\nAnswer:",

So, we add \"lan\" to \"akıl\" to form \"akıllan\" which means \"to become wise\" or \"to come to one's senses\".\n2. \"m\" is a first-person singular suffix in the present tense for verbs. When added to \"akıllan\", it changes the verb to the first person, resulting in \"akıllanm\" which is not a complete word yet because it lacks the vowel harmony.\n3. \"dı\" is a past tense suffix for verbs. It should be attached to a verb to indicate past action. In this case, we add \"dı\" to \"akıllanm\" to form \"akıllandı\" which means \"he/she/it became wise\" or \"came to his/her/its senses\".\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n- \"lan\" to form \"akıllan\"\n- \"m\" to form \"akıllanm\" (which is not a complete word and needs vowel harmony)\n- \"dı\" to form \"akıllandı\"\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"akıl\" in \"akıllandı\" with our novel root \"ubıl\" to get the final answer \"ubıllandı\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ubıllandı</Answer>",

Given novel root \"kıkın\" is defined to mean \"yakın\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yakın\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"yakın\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. yakın + laş = yakınlaş (to become close)\n2. yakınlaş + tık = yakınlaştık (we became close)\n3. yakınlaştık + ça = yakınlaştıkça (as we become close)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word:\n\n1. laş\n2. tık\n3. ça\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not included any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yakın\" in \"yakınlaştıkça\" with our novel root \"kıkın\" to get the final answer \"kıkınlaştıkça\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>kıkınlaştıkça</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: nebü\nDefinition: nebü means büyü in Turkish.\nAffixes: çesine, miş, len\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"nebü\" is defined to mean \"büyü\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"büyü\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"büyü\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"len\" is a passive or reflexive suffix that can be added directly to the root to make it an adjective or to give a meaning that the action is done to the subject itself. So we get \"büyülen\".\n\n2. \"miş\" is a suffix used to indicate hearsay or past experience that the speaker did not directly witness. It is often used after a verb, so we can add it to \"büyülen\" to create a verb in the past tense that implies hearsay. We get \"büyülenmiş\".\n\n3. \"çesine\" is a suffix that is used to indicate a manner or way of doing something, similar to the English \"-like\" or \"-as if\". It is added to the end of the word. So we add it to \"büyülenmiş\" to get \"büyülenmişçesine\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\nRoot: büyü\nAffixes: len, miş, çesine\nConstructed word: büyülenmişçesine\n\nTo verify adherence to the rules:\n- Each affix is used exactly once.\n- All provided affixes are used.\n- No extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"büyü\" in \"büyülenmişçesine\" with our novel root \"nebü\" to get the final answer \"nebülenmişçesine\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nebülenmişçesine</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: mıymet\nDefinition: mıymet means farket in Turkish.\nAffixes: me, se, k\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mıymet\" is defined to mean \"farket\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"farket\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the root given:\n\nRoot: farket\nAffixes: me, se, k\n\nIn Turkish, the affix \"me\" is a negation suffix for verbs, \"se\" is a conditional suffix, and \"k\" is a past tense suffix for verbs in the narrative (rarely used) or as a necessity mood marker.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be:\n1. \"me\" to negate the verb,\n2. \"se\" to turn it into a conditional mood,\n3. \"k\" to indicate past tense or necessity.\n\nSo, the constructed word would be \"farketmese\" (if it had not been noticed), but since we have the \"k\" affix, which doesn't fit well after \"se\" in this context, we might need to reconsider the order or the use of \"k\". The \"k\" suffix is not commonly used in modern Turkish and might be a typo or a mistake. If we ignore the \"k\" and just use \"me\" and \"se\", we get \"farketmese\" which is a grammatically correct word.\n\nHowever, if we are to use all affixes, the \"k\" would typically come before \"se\" to form a word that is grammatically correct but not commonly used in modern Turkish. The word would be \"farketmekse\" (if it is to be noticed/noticed), but this construction is highly unusual and not standard.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal of using all affixes once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"farket\" in \"farketmekse\" with our novel root \"mıymet\" to get the final answer \"mıymetmekse\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mıymetmekse</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: lilgi\nDefinition: lilgi means sevgi in Turkish.\nAffixes: in, li, m\nAnswer:",

Given novel root \"lilgi\" is defined to mean \"sevgi\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"sevgi\" using the given affixes. First, let's append the affixes to the root \"sevgi\" in a grammatically correct order:\n\n1. \"li\" is a suffix that can be added to a noun to form an adjective meaning \"with\" or \"having\". So, we add \"li\" to \"sevgi\" to form \"sevgili\" which means \"beloved\" or \"dear\".\n2. \"m\" is a possessive suffix for the first person singular. It should be attached to a noun to indicate \"my\". In this case, we add \"m\" to \"sevgili\" to form \"sevgilim\" which means \"my beloved\" or \"my dear\".\n3. \"in\" is a possessive suffix for the second person singular. However, since we already used the first person possessive suffix \"m\", we cannot grammatically use \"in\" in the same word to indicate second person possession. In Turkish, a word cannot have two different possessive suffixes at the same time. Therefore, we need to reconsider the order of affixes.\n\nSince the given affixes do not seem to fit together in a grammatically correct way for the root \"sevgi\", we might need to think of a different construction. However, if we are to use all affixes, we could consider \"in\" as a plural suffix (which is actually \"in\" with a dotless \"i\" - \"ler\" or \"lar\" in Turkish) and \"m\" as a separate word meaning \"am\" or \"is\" (which is actually \"im\" or \"ım\" in Turkish). But these interpretations are not consistent with the standard use of these affixes in Turkish.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal of using all affixes once, we can construct the word \"sevgilim\" (my beloved) and consider \"in\" as a separate word meaning \"is\" (though this is not standard Turkish grammar). \n\nNow we replace the root \"sevgi\" in \"sevgilim\" with our novel root \"lilgi\" to get the final answer \"lilgim\" and consider \"in\" as a separate word meaning \"is\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>lilgim</Answer> \n\nPlease note that this construction is not standard in Turkish and the use of \"in\" as \"is\" is not grammatically correct. The correct use of \"in\" would be as a possessive suffix for the second person singular, but it cannot be used in conjunction with the first person possessive suffix \"m\" in the same word.",

Given novel root \"yabufa\" is defined to mean \"kovala\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kovala\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"kovala\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"diğ\" is a relative suffix that turns a verb into an adjective or a noun.\n2. \"yabil\" is a potential mood suffix that indicates the ability to do the action of the verb.\n3. \"im\" is a possessive suffix for the first person singular.\n4. \"iz\" is a plural suffix for the first person.\n\nThe correct order for these affixes would be to first turn the verb into a potential mood, then make it into a noun with the relative suffix, and finally add the possessive and plural suffixes.\n\nSo, the construction would be as follows:\n- kovala (root) + yabil (potential mood) = kovalayabil\n- kovalayabil + diğ (relative suffix) = kovalayabildiğ\n- kovalayabildiğ + im (first person singular possessive) = kovalayabildiğim\n- kovalayabildiğim + iz (first person plural) = kovalayabildiğimiz\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kovala\" in \"kovalayabildiğimiz\" with our novel root \"yabufa\" to get the final answer \"yabufayabildiğimiz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yabufayabildiğimiz</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: yübek\nDefinition: yübek means bebek in Turkish.\nAffixes: in, lik, ler, de\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"yübek\" is defined to mean \"bebek\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"bebek\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions in Turkish:\n\n- \"in\" is a possessive suffix for the third person singular (his/her/its).\n- \"lik\" is a suffix that can turn a noun into another noun, often indicating a state, condition, or quality.\n- \"ler\" is a plural suffix for nouns.\n- \"de\" is a locative suffix indicating the location (on, at, in).\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: bebek (baby)\n2. Add \"lik\" to form a noun that indicates a state or quality: bebeklik (childhood)\n3. Add \"ler\" to pluralize: bebeklikler (childhoods)\n4. Add \"in\" to indicate possession: bebekliklerin (of the childhoods)\n5. Add \"de\" to indicate location: bebekliklerinde (in the childhoods)\n\nAll provided affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"bebek\" in \"bebekliklerinde\" with our novel root \"yübek\" to get the final answer \"yübekliklerinde\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yübekliklerinde</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: yarun\nDefinition: yarun means bulun in Turkish.\nAffixes: ma, ma, sı, na\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"yarun\" is defined to mean \"bulun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"bulun\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We have the root \"bulun\" and the affixes \"ma, ma, sı, na\". Since we have two \"ma\" affixes, we need to be careful about their placement and function in the word.\n\n1. The first \"ma\" is likely a negation suffix for verbs.\n2. The second \"ma\" could be a nominalization suffix, turning the verb into a noun.\n3. The \"sı\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular).\n4. The \"na\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nLet's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunma\" (not to be found)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its not being found)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its not being found)\n\nHowever, we still have one \"ma\" left, which is a nominalization suffix. We need to use it to turn the verb into a noun before we can add the possessive and dative suffixes:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (nominalization) = \"bulunma\" (the act of finding)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its finding)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its finding)\n4. \"bulunmasına\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunmamasına\" (to his/her/its not finding)\n\nNow we have used all the affixes correctly and constructed a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"bulun\" in \"bulunmamasına\" with our novel root \"yarun\" to get the final answer \"yarunmamasına\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yarunmamasına</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: mırdı\nDefinition: mırdı means şarkı in Turkish.\nAffixes: ki, lar, da, ın\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mırdı\" is defined to mean \"şarkı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"şarkı\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"şarkı\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"şarkı\" is the root word meaning \"song\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix.\n3. \"ın\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular \"his/her/its\").\n4. \"da\" is a locative suffix (meaning \"in/at\").\n5. \"ki\" is a suffix that is used to form an adjective from a noun phrase.\n\nThe correct order for the affixes would be:\n\n1. \"şarkı\" + \"lar\" = \"şarkılar\" (songs)\n2. \"şarkılar\" + \"ın\" = \"şarkıların\" (of the songs)\n3. \"şarkıların\" + \"da\" = \"şarkılarında\" (in their songs)\n4. \"şarkılarında\" + \"ki\" = \"şarkılarındaki\" (the ones in their songs)\n\nSo the final word is \"şarkılarındaki\". All affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included. \n\nNow we replace the root \"şarkı\" in \"şarkılarındaki\" with our novel root \"mırdı\" to get the final answer \"mırdılarındaki\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mırdılarındaki</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: lavay\nDefinition: lavay means kolay in Turkish.\nAffixes: laş, ma, tır, sa\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"lavay\" is defined to mean \"kolay\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kolay\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the order in which they should be appended to the root \"kolay\" to form a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n1. \"laş\" - This is a derivational suffix that can be used to form an adjective or verb, often indicating becoming or getting to be in the state of the root.\n2. \"ma\" - This is a negation suffix that is often used to form the negative of verbs.\n3. \"tır\" - This is a causative suffix that can be used to form verbs that mean to make or cause to do something.\n4. \"sa\" - This is a conditional suffix that is used to form the conditional mood of verbs.\n\nThe correct order to append these affixes to the root \"kolay\" would be:\n\n1. kolay + laş = kolaylaş (to become easy)\n2. kolaylaş + tır = kolaylaştır (to make something become easy)\n3. kolaylaştır + ma = kolaylaştırma (to not make something become easy)\n4. kolaylaştırma + sa = kolaylaştırmasa (if [he/she/it] does not make something become easy)\n\nSo the final word is \"kolaylaştırmasa\".\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, no extra affixes are included, and the final word is grammatically correct in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kolay\" in \"kolaylaştırmasa\" with our novel root \"lavay\" to get the final answer \"lavaylaştırmasa\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>lavaylaştırmasa</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: yımnık\nDefinition: yımnık means mantık in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ın, lık, sız\nAnswer:",

Since we have two \"ma\" affixes, we need to be careful about their placement and function in the word.\n\n1. The first \"ma\" is likely a negation suffix for verbs.\n2. The second \"ma\" could be a nominalization suffix, turning the verb into a noun.\n3. The \"sı\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular).\n4. The \"na\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nLet's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunma\" (not to be found)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its not being found)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its not being found)\n\nHowever, we still have one \"ma\" left, which is a nominalization suffix. We need to use it to turn the verb into a noun before we can add the possessive and dative suffixes:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (nominalization) = \"bulunma\" (the act of finding)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its finding)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its finding)\n4. \"bulunmasına\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunmamasına\" (to his/her/its not finding)\n\nNow we have used all the affixes correctly and constructed a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"bulun\" in \"bulunmamasına\" with our novel root \"yarun\" to get the final answer \"yarunmamasına\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yarunmamasına</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: mırdı\nDefinition: mırdı means şarkı in Turkish.\nAffixes: ki, lar, da, ın\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mırdı\" is defined to mean \"şarkı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"şarkı\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"şarkı\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"şarkı\" is the root word meaning \"song\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix.\n3. \"ın\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular \"his/her/its\").\n4. \"da\" is a locative suffix (meaning \"in/at\").\n5. \"ki\" is a suffix that is used to form an adjective from a noun phrase.\n\nThe correct order for the affixes would be:\n\n1. \"şarkı\" + \"lar\" = \"şarkılar\" (songs)\n2. \"şarkılar\" + \"ın\" = \"şarkıların\" (of the songs)\n3. \"şarkıların\" + \"da\" = \"şarkılarında\" (in their songs)\n4. \"şarkılarında\" + \"ki\" = \"şarkılarındaki\" (the ones in their songs)\n\nSo the final word is \"şarkılarındaki\". All affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included. \n\nNow we replace the root \"şarkı\" in \"şarkılarındaki\" with our novel root \"mırdı\" to get the final answer \"mırdılarındaki\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mırdılarındaki</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: lavay\nDefinition: lavay means kolay in Turkish.\nAffixes: laş, ma, tır, sa\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"lavay\" is defined to mean \"kolay\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kolay\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the order in which they should be appended to the root \"kolay\" to form a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n1. \"laş\" - This is a derivational suffix that can be used to form an adjective or verb, often indicating becoming or getting to be in the state of the root.\n2. \"ma\" - This is a negation suffix that is often used to form the negative of verbs.\n3. \"tır\" - This is a causative suffix that can be used to form verbs that mean to make or cause to do something.\n4. \"sa\" - This is a conditional suffix that is used to form the conditional mood of verbs.\n\nThe correct order to append these affixes to the root \"kolay\" would be:\n\n1. kolay + laş = kolaylaş (to become easy)\n2. kolaylaş + tır = kolaylaştır (to make something become easy)\n3. kolaylaştır + ma = kolaylaştırma (to not make something become easy)\n4. kolaylaştırma + sa = kolaylaştırmasa (if [he/she/it] does not make something become easy)\n\nSo the final word is \"kolaylaştırmasa\".\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, no extra affixes are included, and the final word is grammatically correct in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kolay\" in \"kolaylaştırmasa\" with our novel root \"lavay\" to get the final answer \"lavaylaştırmasa\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>lavaylaştırmasa</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: dazak\nDefinition: dazak means bak in Turkish.\nAffixes: ıcı, lığ, ı, ın\nAnswer:",

The \"na\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nLet's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunma\" (not to be found)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its not being found)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its not being found)\n\nHowever, we still have one \"ma\" left, which is a nominalization suffix. We need to use it to turn the verb into a noun before we can add the possessive and dative suffixes:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (nominalization) = \"bulunma\" (the act of finding)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its finding)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its finding)\n4. \"bulunmasına\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunmamasına\" (to his/her/its not finding)\n\nNow we have used all the affixes correctly and constructed a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"bulun\" in \"bulunmamasına\" with our novel root \"yarun\" to get the final answer \"yarunmamasına\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yarunmamasına</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: mırdı\nDefinition: mırdı means şarkı in Turkish.\nAffixes: ki, lar, da, ın\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mırdı\" is defined to mean \"şarkı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"şarkı\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"şarkı\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"şarkı\" is the root word meaning \"song\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix.\n3. \"ın\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular \"his/her/its\").\n4. \"da\" is a locative suffix (meaning \"in/at\").\n5. \"ki\" is a suffix that is used to form an adjective from a noun phrase.\n\nThe correct order for the affixes would be:\n\n1. \"şarkı\" + \"lar\" = \"şarkılar\" (songs)\n2. \"şarkılar\" + \"ın\" = \"şarkıların\" (of the songs)\n3. \"şarkıların\" + \"da\" = \"şarkılarında\" (in their songs)\n4. \"şarkılarında\" + \"ki\" = \"şarkılarındaki\" (the ones in their songs)\n\nSo the final word is \"şarkılarındaki\". All affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included. \n\nNow we replace the root \"şarkı\" in \"şarkılarındaki\" with our novel root \"mırdı\" to get the final answer \"mırdılarındaki\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mırdılarındaki</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: lavay\nDefinition: lavay means kolay in Turkish.\nAffixes: laş, ma, tır, sa\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"lavay\" is defined to mean \"kolay\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kolay\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the order in which they should be appended to the root \"kolay\" to form a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n1. \"laş\" - This is a derivational suffix that can be used to form an adjective or verb, often indicating becoming or getting to be in the state of the root.\n2. \"ma\" - This is a negation suffix that is often used to form the negative of verbs.\n3. \"tır\" - This is a causative suffix that can be used to form verbs that mean to make or cause to do something.\n4. \"sa\" - This is a conditional suffix that is used to form the conditional mood of verbs.\n\nThe correct order to append these affixes to the root \"kolay\" would be:\n\n1. kolay + laş = kolaylaş (to become easy)\n2. kolaylaş + tır = kolaylaştır (to make something become easy)\n3. kolaylaştır + ma = kolaylaştırma (to not make something become easy)\n4. kolaylaştırma + sa = kolaylaştırmasa (if [he/she/it] does not make something become easy)\n\nSo the final word is \"kolaylaştırmasa\".\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, no extra affixes are included, and the final word is grammatically correct in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kolay\" in \"kolaylaştırmasa\" with our novel root \"lavay\" to get the final answer \"lavaylaştırmasa\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>lavaylaştırmasa</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: biderse\nDefinition: biderse means benimse in Turkish.\nAffixes: si, dir, me, n\nAnswer:",

We need to use it to turn the verb into a noun before we can add the possessive and dative suffixes:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (nominalization) = \"bulunma\" (the act of finding)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its finding)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its finding)\n4. \"bulunmasına\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunmamasına\" (to his/her/its not finding)\n\nNow we have used all the affixes correctly and constructed a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"bulun\" in \"bulunmamasına\" with our novel root \"yarun\" to get the final answer \"yarunmamasına\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yarunmamasına</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: mırdı\nDefinition: mırdı means şarkı in Turkish.\nAffixes: ki, lar, da, ın\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mırdı\" is defined to mean \"şarkı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"şarkı\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"şarkı\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"şarkı\" is the root word meaning \"song\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix.\n3. \"ın\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular \"his/her/its\").\n4. \"da\" is a locative suffix (meaning \"in/at\").\n5. \"ki\" is a suffix that is used to form an adjective from a noun phrase.\n\nThe correct order for the affixes would be:\n\n1. \"şarkı\" + \"lar\" = \"şarkılar\" (songs)\n2. \"şarkılar\" + \"ın\" = \"şarkıların\" (of the songs)\n3. \"şarkıların\" + \"da\" = \"şarkılarında\" (in their songs)\n4. \"şarkılarında\" + \"ki\" = \"şarkılarındaki\" (the ones in their songs)\n\nSo the final word is \"şarkılarındaki\". All affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included. \n\nNow we replace the root \"şarkı\" in \"şarkılarındaki\" with our novel root \"mırdı\" to get the final answer \"mırdılarındaki\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mırdılarındaki</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: lavay\nDefinition: lavay means kolay in Turkish.\nAffixes: laş, ma, tır, sa\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"lavay\" is defined to mean \"kolay\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kolay\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the order in which they should be appended to the root \"kolay\" to form a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n1. \"laş\" - This is a derivational suffix that can be used to form an adjective or verb, often indicating becoming or getting to be in the state of the root.\n2. \"ma\" - This is a negation suffix that is often used to form the negative of verbs.\n3. \"tır\" - This is a causative suffix that can be used to form verbs that mean to make or cause to do something.\n4. \"sa\" - This is a conditional suffix that is used to form the conditional mood of verbs.\n\nThe correct order to append these affixes to the root \"kolay\" would be:\n\n1. kolay + laş = kolaylaş (to become easy)\n2. kolaylaş + tır = kolaylaştır (to make something become easy)\n3. kolaylaştır + ma = kolaylaştırma (to not make something become easy)\n4. kolaylaştırma + sa = kolaylaştırmasa (if [he/she/it] does not make something become easy)\n\nSo the final word is \"kolaylaştırmasa\".\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, no extra affixes are included, and the final word is grammatically correct in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kolay\" in \"kolaylaştırmasa\" with our novel root \"lavay\" to get the final answer \"lavaylaştırmasa\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>lavaylaştırmasa</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: ribüş\nDefinition: ribüş means dönüş in Turkish.\nAffixes: düğ, de, ünüz, tür\nAnswer:",

Given novel root \"yarun\" is defined to mean \"bulun\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"bulun\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We have the root \"bulun\" and the affixes \"ma, ma, sı, na\". Since we have two \"ma\" affixes, we need to be careful about their placement and function in the word.\n\n1. The first \"ma\" is likely a negation suffix for verbs.\n2. The second \"ma\" could be a nominalization suffix, turning the verb into a noun.\n3. The \"sı\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular).\n4.

We need to use it to turn the verb into a noun before we can add the possessive and dative suffixes:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (nominalization) = \"bulunma\" (the act of finding)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its finding)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its finding)\n4. \"bulunmasına\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunmamasına\" (to his/her/its not finding)\n\nNow we have used all the affixes correctly and constructed a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"bulun\" in \"bulunmamasına\" with our novel root \"yarun\" to get the final answer \"yarunmamasına\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yarunmamasına</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: mırdı\nDefinition: mırdı means şarkı in Turkish.\nAffixes: ki, lar, da, ın\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mırdı\" is defined to mean \"şarkı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"şarkı\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"şarkı\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"şarkı\" is the root word meaning \"song\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix.\n3. \"ın\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular \"his/her/its\").\n4. \"da\" is a locative suffix (meaning \"in/at\").\n5. \"ki\" is a suffix that is used to form an adjective from a noun phrase.\n\nThe correct order for the affixes would be:\n\n1. \"şarkı\" + \"lar\" = \"şarkılar\" (songs)\n2. \"şarkılar\" + \"ın\" = \"şarkıların\" (of the songs)\n3. \"şarkıların\" + \"da\" = \"şarkılarında\" (in their songs)\n4. \"şarkılarında\" + \"ki\" = \"şarkılarındaki\" (the ones in their songs)\n\nSo the final word is \"şarkılarındaki\". All affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included. \n\nNow we replace the root \"şarkı\" in \"şarkılarındaki\" with our novel root \"mırdı\" to get the final answer \"mırdılarındaki\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mırdılarındaki</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: lavay\nDefinition: lavay means kolay in Turkish.\nAffixes: laş, ma, tır, sa\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"lavay\" is defined to mean \"kolay\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kolay\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the order in which they should be appended to the root \"kolay\" to form a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n1. \"laş\" - This is a derivational suffix that can be used to form an adjective or verb, often indicating becoming or getting to be in the state of the root.\n2. \"ma\" - This is a negation suffix that is often used to form the negative of verbs.\n3. \"tır\" - This is a causative suffix that can be used to form verbs that mean to make or cause to do something.\n4. \"sa\" - This is a conditional suffix that is used to form the conditional mood of verbs.\n\nThe correct order to append these affixes to the root \"kolay\" would be:\n\n1. kolay + laş = kolaylaş (to become easy)\n2. kolaylaş + tır = kolaylaştır (to make something become easy)\n3. kolaylaştır + ma = kolaylaştırma (to not make something become easy)\n4. kolaylaştırma + sa = kolaylaştırmasa (if [he/she/it] does not make something become easy)\n\nSo the final word is \"kolaylaştırmasa\".\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, no extra affixes are included, and the final word is grammatically correct in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kolay\" in \"kolaylaştırmasa\" with our novel root \"lavay\" to get the final answer \"lavaylaştırmasa\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>lavaylaştırmasa</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: bülidan\nDefinition: bülidan means heyecan in Turkish.\nAffixes: yan, lan, ma, dır\nAnswer:",

We need to use it to turn the verb into a noun before we can add the possessive and dative suffixes:\n\n1. \"bulun\" + \"ma\" (nominalization) = \"bulunma\" (the act of finding)\n2. \"bulunma\" + \"sı\" (possessive) = \"bulunması\" (his/her/its finding)\n3. \"bulunması\" + \"na\" (dative) = \"bulunmasına\" (to his/her/its finding)\n4. \"bulunmasına\" + \"ma\" (negation) = \"bulunmamasına\" (to his/her/its not finding)\n\nNow we have used all the affixes correctly and constructed a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"bulun\" in \"bulunmamasına\" with our novel root \"yarun\" to get the final answer \"yarunmamasına\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yarunmamasına</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: mırdı\nDefinition: mırdı means şarkı in Turkish.\nAffixes: ki, lar, da, ın\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mırdı\" is defined to mean \"şarkı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"şarkı\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"şarkı\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"şarkı\" is the root word meaning \"song\".\n2. \"lar\" is a plural suffix.\n3. \"ın\" is a possessive suffix (3rd person singular \"his/her/its\").\n4. \"da\" is a locative suffix (meaning \"in/at\").\n5. \"ki\" is a suffix that is used to form an adjective from a noun phrase.\n\nThe correct order for the affixes would be:\n\n1. \"şarkı\" + \"lar\" = \"şarkılar\" (songs)\n2. \"şarkılar\" + \"ın\" = \"şarkıların\" (of the songs)\n3. \"şarkıların\" + \"da\" = \"şarkılarında\" (in their songs)\n4. \"şarkılarında\" + \"ki\" = \"şarkılarındaki\" (the ones in their songs)\n\nSo the final word is \"şarkılarındaki\". All affixes are used exactly once, and no extra affixes are included. \n\nNow we replace the root \"şarkı\" in \"şarkılarındaki\" with our novel root \"mırdı\" to get the final answer \"mırdılarındaki\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mırdılarındaki</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: lavay\nDefinition: lavay means kolay in Turkish.\nAffixes: laş, ma, tır, sa\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"lavay\" is defined to mean \"kolay\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kolay\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and the order in which they should be appended to the root \"kolay\" to form a grammatically correct word in Turkish.\n\n1. \"laş\" - This is a derivational suffix that can be used to form an adjective or verb, often indicating becoming or getting to be in the state of the root.\n2. \"ma\" - This is a negation suffix that is often used to form the negative of verbs.\n3. \"tır\" - This is a causative suffix that can be used to form verbs that mean to make or cause to do something.\n4. \"sa\" - This is a conditional suffix that is used to form the conditional mood of verbs.\n\nThe correct order to append these affixes to the root \"kolay\" would be:\n\n1. kolay + laş = kolaylaş (to become easy)\n2. kolaylaş + tır = kolaylaştır (to make something become easy)\n3. kolaylaştır + ma = kolaylaştırma (to not make something become easy)\n4. kolaylaştırma + sa = kolaylaştırmasa (if [he/she/it] does not make something become easy)\n\nSo the final word is \"kolaylaştırmasa\".\n\nAll affixes are used exactly once, no extra affixes are included, and the final word is grammatically correct in Turkish.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kolay\" in \"kolaylaştırmasa\" with our novel root \"lavay\" to get the final answer \"lavaylaştırmasa\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>lavaylaştırmasa</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: şükşol\nDefinition: şükşol means sembol in Turkish.\nAffixes: ir, ler, leş, tir\nAnswer:",

Given novel root \"nıbıt\" is defined to mean \"yapıt\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yapıt\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. The affixes provided need to be appended in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"ler\" or \"lar\" - Plural suffix, used to pluralize nouns or adjectives. It must agree in vowel harmony with the word root.\n2. \"den\" - Ablative case suffix, indicating \"from\" or \"than\" something.\n3. \"da\" - Locative case suffix, indicating \"in\" or \"at\" something.\n4. \"ki\" - A suffix that forms an adjective from a noun or pronoun, often equivalent to the English \"that\" or \"which.\"\n\nGiven the word root \"yapıt\" (which means \"work\" or \"piece of art\"), we need to determine the correct order of affixes. The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"yapıt\" (root)\n2. \"lar\" (plural suffix, because \"yapıt\" ends with a back vowel, we use \"lar\" instead of \"ler\" for vowel harmony)\n3. \"da\" (locative case suffix, to be used after pluralizing the noun)\n4. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix, which should come after the case suffix)\n5. \"den\" (ablative case suffix, which should be the last one as it indicates \"from\" the previously described location)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"yapıtlardakilerden\".\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"den\" (ablative case suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yapıt\" in \"yapıtlardakilerden\" with our novel root \"nıbıt\" to get the final answer \"nıbıtlardakilerden\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nıbıtlardakilerden</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: rusvak\nDefinition: rusvak means kaynak in Turkish.\nAffixes: dır, mak, lan, ma, ta\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"rusvak\" is defined to mean \"kaynak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaynak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the correct order of affixes. The root word is \"kaynak,\" and the affixes are \"dır,\" \"mak,\" \"lan,\" \"ma,\" \"ta.\" \n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of affixes we have:\n- \"mak\" is a verbal infinitive marker.\n- \"lan\" is a reflexive/passive voice marker for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation marker for verbs.\n- \"ta\" is a locative case marker for nouns.\n- \"dır\" is a verbal/nominal predicate marker for certainty/definiteness.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first turn the noun into a verb, then apply reflexivity/passivity if needed, followed by negation, and then the infinitive if we are creating a verb to be used as a noun or another part of speech. Then we can add the locative case and the predicate marker.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kaynak\" would be:\n1. \"lan\" to make it reflexive/passive.\n2. \"ma\" to negate it.\n3. \"mak\" to put it into the infinitive form.\n4. \"ta\" to indicate the state.\n5.\"dır\" to indicate the certainty.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kaynaklanmamaktadır,\" which means \"it is not in the state of not to originate from/be sourced from.\"\n\nNow we replace the root \"kaynak\" in \"kaynaklanmamaktadır\" with our novel root \"rusvak\" to get the final answer \"rusvaklanmamaktadır\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>rusvaklanmamaktadır</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: dondı\nDefinition: dondı means karşı in Turkish.\nAffixes: abil, eceğ, im, iz, laş\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dondı\" is defined to mean \"karşı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"karşı\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"abil\" is a potential mood suffix that can be attached to verbs to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb.\n- \"eceğ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"im\" is a first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"iz\" is a first-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"laş\" is a reciprocal or reflexive verb-forming suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"karşı\" can function as a noun or an adjective. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb first. We can do this by adding the reflexive/reciprocal suffix \"laş\" to form \"karşılaş,\" which means \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"karşı\" in \"karşılaşabileceğimiz\" with our novel root \"dondı\" to get the final answer \"dondılaşabileceğimiz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dondılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: reküst\nDefinition: reküst means üst in Turkish.\nAffixes: ler, ü, nde, le, ki\nAnswer:",

Given novel root \"nıbıt\" is defined to mean \"yapıt\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yapıt\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. The affixes provided need to be appended in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"ler\" or \"lar\" - Plural suffix, used to pluralize nouns or adjectives. It must agree in vowel harmony with the word root.\n2. \"den\" - Ablative case suffix, indicating \"from\" or \"than\" something.\n3. \"da\" - Locative case suffix, indicating \"in\" or \"at\" something.\n4. \"ki\" - A suffix that forms an adjective from a noun or pronoun, often equivalent to the English \"that\" or \"which.\"\n\nGiven the word root \"yapıt\" (which means \"work\" or \"piece of art\"), we need to determine the correct order of affixes. The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"yapıt\" (root)\n2. \"lar\" (plural suffix, because \"yapıt\" ends with a back vowel, we use \"lar\" instead of \"ler\" for vowel harmony)\n3. \"da\" (locative case suffix, to be used after pluralizing the noun)\n4. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix, which should come after the case suffix)\n5. \"den\" (ablative case suffix, which should be the last one as it indicates \"from\" the previously described location)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"yapıtlardakilerden\".\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"den\" (ablative case suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yapıt\" in \"yapıtlardakilerden\" with our novel root \"nıbıt\" to get the final answer \"nıbıtlardakilerden\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nıbıtlardakilerden</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: rusvak\nDefinition: rusvak means kaynak in Turkish.\nAffixes: dır, mak, lan, ma, ta\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"rusvak\" is defined to mean \"kaynak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaynak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the correct order of affixes. The root word is \"kaynak,\" and the affixes are \"dır,\" \"mak,\" \"lan,\" \"ma,\" \"ta.\" \n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of affixes we have:\n- \"mak\" is a verbal infinitive marker.\n- \"lan\" is a reflexive/passive voice marker for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation marker for verbs.\n- \"ta\" is a locative case marker for nouns.\n- \"dır\" is a verbal/nominal predicate marker for certainty/definiteness.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first turn the noun into a verb, then apply reflexivity/passivity if needed, followed by negation, and then the infinitive if we are creating a verb to be used as a noun or another part of speech. Then we can add the locative case and the predicate marker.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kaynak\" would be:\n1. \"lan\" to make it reflexive/passive.\n2. \"ma\" to negate it.\n3. \"mak\" to put it into the infinitive form.\n4. \"ta\" to indicate the state.\n5.\"dır\" to indicate the certainty.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kaynaklanmamaktadır,\" which means \"it is not in the state of not to originate from/be sourced from.\"\n\nNow we replace the root \"kaynak\" in \"kaynaklanmamaktadır\" with our novel root \"rusvak\" to get the final answer \"rusvaklanmamaktadır\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>rusvaklanmamaktadır</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: dondı\nDefinition: dondı means karşı in Turkish.\nAffixes: abil, eceğ, im, iz, laş\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dondı\" is defined to mean \"karşı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"karşı\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"abil\" is a potential mood suffix that can be attached to verbs to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb.\n- \"eceğ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"im\" is a first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"iz\" is a first-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"laş\" is a reciprocal or reflexive verb-forming suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"karşı\" can function as a noun or an adjective. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb first. We can do this by adding the reflexive/reciprocal suffix \"laş\" to form \"karşılaş,\" which means \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"karşı\" in \"karşılaşabileceğimiz\" with our novel root \"dondı\" to get the final answer \"dondılaşabileceğimiz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dondılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: bülir\nDefinition: bülir means geçir in Turkish.\nAffixes: e, ne, me, me, si\nAnswer:",

We need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax to construct a grammatically correct word. Let's analyze the affixes:\n\n- \"e\" is a dative case suffix indicating the direction towards something or someone.\n- \"ne\" is a question particle that can be used to form question words or, in some cases, as a buffer letter for vowel harmony.\n- \"me\" is a negation suffix for verbs.\n- \"si\" is a third-person singular possessive suffix.\n\nSince we have \"me\" twice in the list, we need to ensure that we use it correctly according to Turkish grammar rules. In Turkish, the negation suffix \"me\" cannot be used twice in a row in the same word. Therefore, we need to interpret one of the \"me\" as a different grammatical element. In this case, we can interpret the second \"me\" as a nominalization suffix that turns a verb into a noun.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"geçir\" is a verb that can mean \"to spend (time)\" or \"to pass (through).\"\n2. We add the negation suffix \"me\" to form \"geçirme,\" meaning \"not to spend\" or \"not to pass.\"\n3. We then add the nominalization suffix \"me\" to turn the verb into a noun, resulting in \"geçirme,\" which can mean \"the act of not spending\" or \"the act of not passing.\"\n4. Next, we add the third-person singular possessive suffix \"si\" to indicate possession, giving us \"geçirmesi,\" meaning \"his/her/its act of not spending\" or \"his/her/its act of not passing.\"\n5. Finally, we add the dative case suffix \"e\" to indicate direction, resulting in \"geçirmesine,\" which can mean \"to his/her/its act of not spending\" or \"to his/her/its act of not passing.\"\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"geçir\" in \"geçirmesine\" with our novel root \"bülir\" to get the final answer \"bülirmesine\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>bülirmesine</Answer>",

We will append the affixes to the root \"kavram\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"kavram\" (concept) is the root.\n2. \"sal\" is a suffix that turns a noun into an adjective (related to).\n3. \"laş\" is a suffix that indicates becoming or getting to be.\n4. \"tır\" is a causative suffix.\n5. \"ma\" is a nominalization suffix that turns a verb into a noun.\n6. \"ya\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. kavram + sal = kavramsal (conceptual)\n2. kavramsal + laş = kavramsallaş (become conceptual)\n3. kavramsallaş + tır = kavramsallaştır (to make conceptual)\n4. kavramsallaştır + ma = kavramsallaştırma (the act of making conceptual)\n5. kavramsallaştırma + ya = kavramsallaştırmaya (to the act of making conceptual)\n\nThe final word is \"kavramsallaştırmaya\".\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kavram\" in \"kavramsallaştırmaya\" with our novel root \"ruygam\" to get the final answer \"ruygamsallaştırmaya\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ruygamsallaştırmaya</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: risin\nDefinition: risin means derin in Turkish.\nAffixes: in, tir, iz, leş, diğ\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"risin\" is defined to mean \"derin\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"derin\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"derin\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"derin\" (deep)\n2. \"derin\" + \"leş\" = \"derinleş\" (to become deep)\n3. \"derinleş\" + \"tir\" = \"derinleştir\" (to make something become deep)\n4. \"derinleştir\" + \"diğ\" = \"derinleştirdiğ\" (that which has made something become deep - a participle form)\n5. \"derinleştirdiğ\" + \"in\" = \"derinleştirdiğin\" (that which you have made become deep - second person singular possessive)\n6. \"derinleştirdiğin\" + \"iz\" = \"derinleştirdiğiniz\" (that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep - second person plural possessive)\n\nThe final word is \"derinleştirdiğiniz,\" and it means \"that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep.\"\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- leş\n- tir\n- diğ\n- in\n- iz.\n\nNow we replace the root \"derin\" in \"derinleştirdiğiniz\" with our novel root \"risin\" to get the final answer \"risinleştirdiğiniz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>risinleştirdiğiniz</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: nıbıt\nDefinition: nıbıt means yapıt in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, den, da, ki, ler\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"nıbıt\" is defined to mean \"yapıt\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yapıt\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. The affixes provided need to be appended in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"ler\" or \"lar\" - Plural suffix, used to pluralize nouns or adjectives. It must agree in vowel harmony with the word root.\n2. \"den\" - Ablative case suffix, indicating \"from\" or \"than\" something.\n3. \"da\" - Locative case suffix, indicating \"in\" or \"at\" something.\n4. \"ki\" - A suffix that forms an adjective from a noun or pronoun, often equivalent to the English \"that\" or \"which.\"\n\nGiven the word root \"yapıt\" (which means \"work\" or \"piece of art\"), we need to determine the correct order of affixes. The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"yapıt\" (root)\n2. \"lar\" (plural suffix, because \"yapıt\" ends with a back vowel, we use \"lar\" instead of \"ler\" for vowel harmony)\n3. \"da\" (locative case suffix, to be used after pluralizing the noun)\n4. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix, which should come after the case suffix)\n5. \"den\" (ablative case suffix, which should be the last one as it indicates \"from\" the previously described location)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"yapıtlardakilerden\".\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"den\" (ablative case suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yapıt\" in \"yapıtlardakilerden\" with our novel root \"nıbıt\" to get the final answer \"nıbıtlardakilerden\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nıbıtlardakilerden</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: rusvak\nDefinition: rusvak means kaynak in Turkish.\nAffixes: dır, mak, lan, ma, ta\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"rusvak\" is defined to mean \"kaynak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaynak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the correct order of affixes. The root word is \"kaynak,\" and the affixes are \"dır,\" \"mak,\" \"lan,\" \"ma,\" \"ta.\" \n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of affixes we have:\n- \"mak\" is a verbal infinitive marker.\n- \"lan\" is a reflexive/passive voice marker for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation marker for verbs.\n- \"ta\" is a locative case marker for nouns.\n- \"dır\" is a verbal/nominal predicate marker for certainty/definiteness.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first turn the noun into a verb, then apply reflexivity/passivity if needed, followed by negation, and then the infinitive if we are creating a verb to be used as a noun or another part of speech. Then we can add the locative case and the predicate marker.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kaynak\" would be:\n1. \"lan\" to make it reflexive/passive.\n2. \"ma\" to negate it.\n3. \"mak\" to put it into the infinitive form.\n4. \"ta\" to indicate the state.\n5.\"dır\" to indicate the certainty.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kaynaklanmamaktadır,\" which means \"it is not in the state of not to originate from/be sourced from.\"\n\nNow we replace the root \"kaynak\" in \"kaynaklanmamaktadır\" with our novel root \"rusvak\" to get the final answer \"rusvaklanmamaktadır\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>rusvaklanmamaktadır</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: dondı\nDefinition: dondı means karşı in Turkish.\nAffixes: abil, eceğ, im, iz, laş\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dondı\" is defined to mean \"karşı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"karşı\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"abil\" is a potential mood suffix that can be attached to verbs to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb.\n- \"eceğ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"im\" is a first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"iz\" is a first-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"laş\" is a reciprocal or reflexive verb-forming suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"karşı\" can function as a noun or an adjective. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb first. We can do this by adding the reflexive/reciprocal suffix \"laş\" to form \"karşılaş,\" which means \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"karşı\" in \"karşılaşabileceğimiz\" with our novel root \"dondı\" to get the final answer \"dondılaşabileceğimiz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dondılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: efve\nDefinition: efve means iste in Turkish.\nAffixes: il, nde, i, n, diğ\nAnswer:",

Given novel root \"ruygam\" is defined to mean \"kavram\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kavram\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"kavram\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"kavram\" (concept) is the root.\n2. \"sal\" is a suffix that turns a noun into an adjective (related to).\n3. \"laş\" is a suffix that indicates becoming or getting to be.\n4. \"tır\" is a causative suffix.\n5. \"ma\" is a nominalization suffix that turns a verb into a noun.\n6. \"ya\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. kavram + sal = kavramsal (conceptual)\n2. kavramsal + laş = kavramsallaş (become conceptual)\n3. kavramsallaş + tır = kavramsallaştır (to make conceptual)\n4. kavramsallaştır + ma = kavramsallaştırma (the act of making conceptual)\n5. kavramsallaştırma + ya = kavramsallaştırmaya (to the act of making conceptual)\n\nThe final word is \"kavramsallaştırmaya\".\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kavram\" in \"kavramsallaştırmaya\" with our novel root \"ruygam\" to get the final answer \"ruygamsallaştırmaya\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ruygamsallaştırmaya</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: risin\nDefinition: risin means derin in Turkish.\nAffixes: in, tir, iz, leş, diğ\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"risin\" is defined to mean \"derin\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"derin\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"derin\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"derin\" (deep)\n2. \"derin\" + \"leş\" = \"derinleş\" (to become deep)\n3. \"derinleş\" + \"tir\" = \"derinleştir\" (to make something become deep)\n4. \"derinleştir\" + \"diğ\" = \"derinleştirdiğ\" (that which has made something become deep - a participle form)\n5. \"derinleştirdiğ\" + \"in\" = \"derinleştirdiğin\" (that which you have made become deep - second person singular possessive)\n6. \"derinleştirdiğin\" + \"iz\" = \"derinleştirdiğiniz\" (that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep - second person plural possessive)\n\nThe final word is \"derinleştirdiğiniz,\" and it means \"that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep.\"\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- leş\n- tir\n- diğ\n- in\n- iz.\n\nNow we replace the root \"derin\" in \"derinleştirdiğiniz\" with our novel root \"risin\" to get the final answer \"risinleştirdiğiniz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>risinleştirdiğiniz</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: nıbıt\nDefinition: nıbıt means yapıt in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, den, da, ki, ler\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"nıbıt\" is defined to mean \"yapıt\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yapıt\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. The affixes provided need to be appended in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"ler\" or \"lar\" - Plural suffix, used to pluralize nouns or adjectives. It must agree in vowel harmony with the word root.\n2. \"den\" - Ablative case suffix, indicating \"from\" or \"than\" something.\n3. \"da\" - Locative case suffix, indicating \"in\" or \"at\" something.\n4. \"ki\" - A suffix that forms an adjective from a noun or pronoun, often equivalent to the English \"that\" or \"which.\"\n\nGiven the word root \"yapıt\" (which means \"work\" or \"piece of art\"), we need to determine the correct order of affixes. The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"yapıt\" (root)\n2. \"lar\" (plural suffix, because \"yapıt\" ends with a back vowel, we use \"lar\" instead of \"ler\" for vowel harmony)\n3. \"da\" (locative case suffix, to be used after pluralizing the noun)\n4. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix, which should come after the case suffix)\n5. \"den\" (ablative case suffix, which should be the last one as it indicates \"from\" the previously described location)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"yapıtlardakilerden\".\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"den\" (ablative case suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yapıt\" in \"yapıtlardakilerden\" with our novel root \"nıbıt\" to get the final answer \"nıbıtlardakilerden\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nıbıtlardakilerden</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: rusvak\nDefinition: rusvak means kaynak in Turkish.\nAffixes: dır, mak, lan, ma, ta\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"rusvak\" is defined to mean \"kaynak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaynak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the correct order of affixes. The root word is \"kaynak,\" and the affixes are \"dır,\" \"mak,\" \"lan,\" \"ma,\" \"ta.\" \n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of affixes we have:\n- \"mak\" is a verbal infinitive marker.\n- \"lan\" is a reflexive/passive voice marker for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation marker for verbs.\n- \"ta\" is a locative case marker for nouns.\n- \"dır\" is a verbal/nominal predicate marker for certainty/definiteness.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first turn the noun into a verb, then apply reflexivity/passivity if needed, followed by negation, and then the infinitive if we are creating a verb to be used as a noun or another part of speech. Then we can add the locative case and the predicate marker.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kaynak\" would be:\n1. \"lan\" to make it reflexive/passive.\n2. \"ma\" to negate it.\n3. \"mak\" to put it into the infinitive form.\n4. \"ta\" to indicate the state.\n5.\"dır\" to indicate the certainty.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kaynaklanmamaktadır,\" which means \"it is not in the state of not to originate from/be sourced from.\"\n\nNow we replace the root \"kaynak\" in \"kaynaklanmamaktadır\" with our novel root \"rusvak\" to get the final answer \"rusvaklanmamaktadır\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>rusvaklanmamaktadır</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: dondı\nDefinition: dondı means karşı in Turkish.\nAffixes: abil, eceğ, im, iz, laş\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dondı\" is defined to mean \"karşı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"karşı\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"abil\" is a potential mood suffix that can be attached to verbs to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb.\n- \"eceğ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"im\" is a first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"iz\" is a first-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"laş\" is a reciprocal or reflexive verb-forming suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"karşı\" can function as a noun or an adjective. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb first. We can do this by adding the reflexive/reciprocal suffix \"laş\" to form \"karşılaş,\" which means \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"karşı\" in \"karşılaşabileceğimiz\" with our novel root \"dondı\" to get the final answer \"dondılaşabileceğimiz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dondılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: nokış\nDefinition: nokış means karış in Turkish.\nAffixes: ız, tır, ım, ma, dığ\nAnswer:",

Given novel root \"ruygam\" is defined to mean \"kavram\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kavram\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"kavram\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"kavram\" (concept) is the root.\n2. \"sal\" is a suffix that turns a noun into an adjective (related to).\n3. \"laş\" is a suffix that indicates becoming or getting to be.\n4. \"tır\" is a causative suffix.\n5. \"ma\" is a nominalization suffix that turns a verb into a noun.\n6. \"ya\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. kavram + sal = kavramsal (conceptual)\n2. kavramsal + laş = kavramsallaş (become conceptual)\n3. kavramsallaş + tır = kavramsallaştır (to make conceptual)\n4. kavramsallaştır + ma = kavramsallaştırma (the act of making conceptual)\n5. kavramsallaştırma + ya = kavramsallaştırmaya (to the act of making conceptual)\n\nThe final word is \"kavramsallaştırmaya\".\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kavram\" in \"kavramsallaştırmaya\" with our novel root \"ruygam\" to get the final answer \"ruygamsallaştırmaya\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ruygamsallaştırmaya</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: risin\nDefinition: risin means derin in Turkish.\nAffixes: in, tir, iz, leş, diğ\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"risin\" is defined to mean \"derin\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"derin\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"derin\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"derin\" (deep)\n2. \"derin\" + \"leş\" = \"derinleş\" (to become deep)\n3. \"derinleş\" + \"tir\" = \"derinleştir\" (to make something become deep)\n4. \"derinleştir\" + \"diğ\" = \"derinleştirdiğ\" (that which has made something become deep - a participle form)\n5. \"derinleştirdiğ\" + \"in\" = \"derinleştirdiğin\" (that which you have made become deep - second person singular possessive)\n6. \"derinleştirdiğin\" + \"iz\" = \"derinleştirdiğiniz\" (that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep - second person plural possessive)\n\nThe final word is \"derinleştirdiğiniz,\" and it means \"that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep.\"\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- leş\n- tir\n- diğ\n- in\n- iz.\n\nNow we replace the root \"derin\" in \"derinleştirdiğiniz\" with our novel root \"risin\" to get the final answer \"risinleştirdiğiniz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>risinleştirdiğiniz</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: nıbıt\nDefinition: nıbıt means yapıt in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, den, da, ki, ler\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"nıbıt\" is defined to mean \"yapıt\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yapıt\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. The affixes provided need to be appended in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"ler\" or \"lar\" - Plural suffix, used to pluralize nouns or adjectives. It must agree in vowel harmony with the word root.\n2. \"den\" - Ablative case suffix, indicating \"from\" or \"than\" something.\n3. \"da\" - Locative case suffix, indicating \"in\" or \"at\" something.\n4. \"ki\" - A suffix that forms an adjective from a noun or pronoun, often equivalent to the English \"that\" or \"which.\"\n\nGiven the word root \"yapıt\" (which means \"work\" or \"piece of art\"), we need to determine the correct order of affixes. The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"yapıt\" (root)\n2. \"lar\" (plural suffix, because \"yapıt\" ends with a back vowel, we use \"lar\" instead of \"ler\" for vowel harmony)\n3. \"da\" (locative case suffix, to be used after pluralizing the noun)\n4. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix, which should come after the case suffix)\n5. \"den\" (ablative case suffix, which should be the last one as it indicates \"from\" the previously described location)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"yapıtlardakilerden\".\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"den\" (ablative case suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yapıt\" in \"yapıtlardakilerden\" with our novel root \"nıbıt\" to get the final answer \"nıbıtlardakilerden\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nıbıtlardakilerden</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: rusvak\nDefinition: rusvak means kaynak in Turkish.\nAffixes: dır, mak, lan, ma, ta\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"rusvak\" is defined to mean \"kaynak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaynak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the correct order of affixes. The root word is \"kaynak,\" and the affixes are \"dır,\" \"mak,\" \"lan,\" \"ma,\" \"ta.\" \n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of affixes we have:\n- \"mak\" is a verbal infinitive marker.\n- \"lan\" is a reflexive/passive voice marker for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation marker for verbs.\n- \"ta\" is a locative case marker for nouns.\n- \"dır\" is a verbal/nominal predicate marker for certainty/definiteness.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first turn the noun into a verb, then apply reflexivity/passivity if needed, followed by negation, and then the infinitive if we are creating a verb to be used as a noun or another part of speech. Then we can add the locative case and the predicate marker.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kaynak\" would be:\n1. \"lan\" to make it reflexive/passive.\n2. \"ma\" to negate it.\n3. \"mak\" to put it into the infinitive form.\n4. \"ta\" to indicate the state.\n5.\"dır\" to indicate the certainty.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kaynaklanmamaktadır,\" which means \"it is not in the state of not to originate from/be sourced from.\"\n\nNow we replace the root \"kaynak\" in \"kaynaklanmamaktadır\" with our novel root \"rusvak\" to get the final answer \"rusvaklanmamaktadır\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>rusvaklanmamaktadır</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: dondı\nDefinition: dondı means karşı in Turkish.\nAffixes: abil, eceğ, im, iz, laş\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dondı\" is defined to mean \"karşı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"karşı\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"abil\" is a potential mood suffix that can be attached to verbs to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb.\n- \"eceğ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"im\" is a first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"iz\" is a first-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"laş\" is a reciprocal or reflexive verb-forming suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"karşı\" can function as a noun or an adjective. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb first. We can do this by adding the reflexive/reciprocal suffix \"laş\" to form \"karşılaş,\" which means \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"karşı\" in \"karşılaşabileceğimiz\" with our novel root \"dondı\" to get the final answer \"dondılaşabileceğimiz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dondılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: yucçura\nDefinition: yucçura means karşıla in Turkish.\nAffixes: ın, ız, ma, yacağ, ş\nAnswer:",

The root \"karşıla\" is already a verb, meaning \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. We can add the negation suffix \"ma\" to indicate the negation of the action. This gives us \"karşılama,\" meaning \"not meet\" or \"not encounter.\"\n\n3. Next, we can add the future tense suffix \"yacağ\" to indicate a future action.

Finally, we need to add the possessive suffixes \"ın\" and \"ız.\" Since \"ın\" is for second person singular and \"ız\" is for second person plural, we need to choose the correct one based on the intended meaning.

Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"lar\" - Plural suffix, used to pluralize nouns or adjectives.\n2. \"nin\" - Genitive case suffix, indicating possession.\n3. \"ki\" - A suffix that forms an adjective from a noun or pronoun, often equivalent to the English \"that\" or \"which.\"\n4. \"an\" - Present participle or adjective-forming suffix.\n5. \"ın\" - Third person singular possessive suffix.\n\nGiven the word root \"çalış\" (which means \"work\" or \"study\"), we need to determine the correct order of affixes. The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"çalış\" (root)\n2. \"an\" (present participle or adjective-forming suffix)\n3. \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n4. \"ın\" (third person singular possessive suffix)\n5. \"nin\" (genitive case suffix)\n6. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"çalışanlarınki,\" which means \"that which belongs to the workers.\"\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"an\" (present participle or adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"ın\" (third person singular possessive suffix)\n- \"nin\" (genitive case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"çalış\" in \"çalışanlarınki\" with our novel root \"nıtış\" to get the final answer \"nıtışanlarınki\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nıtışanlarınki</Answer>",

Given novel root \"ruygam\" is defined to mean \"kavram\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kavram\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"kavram\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"kavram\" (concept) is the root.\n2. \"sal\" is a suffix that turns a noun into an adjective (related to).\n3. \"laş\" is a suffix that indicates becoming or getting to be.\n4. \"tır\" is a causative suffix.\n5. \"ma\" is a nominalization suffix that turns a verb into a noun.\n6. \"ya\" is a dative case suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word:\n\n1. kavram + sal = kavramsal (conceptual)\n2. kavramsal + laş = kavramsallaş (become conceptual)\n3. kavramsallaş + tır = kavramsallaştır (to make conceptual)\n4. kavramsallaştır + ma = kavramsallaştırma (the act of making conceptual)\n5. kavramsallaştırma + ya = kavramsallaştırmaya (to the act of making conceptual)\n\nThe final word is \"kavramsallaştırmaya\".\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kavram\" in \"kavramsallaştırmaya\" with our novel root \"ruygam\" to get the final answer \"ruygamsallaştırmaya\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ruygamsallaştırmaya</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: risin\nDefinition: risin means derin in Turkish.\nAffixes: in, tir, iz, leş, diğ\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"risin\" is defined to mean \"derin\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"derin\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"derin\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish.\n\n1. \"derin\" (deep)\n2. \"derin\" + \"leş\" = \"derinleş\" (to become deep)\n3. \"derinleş\" + \"tir\" = \"derinleştir\" (to make something become deep)\n4. \"derinleştir\" + \"diğ\" = \"derinleştirdiğ\" (that which has made something become deep - a participle form)\n5. \"derinleştirdiğ\" + \"in\" = \"derinleştirdiğin\" (that which you have made become deep - second person singular possessive)\n6. \"derinleştirdiğin\" + \"iz\" = \"derinleştirdiğiniz\" (that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep - second person plural possessive)\n\nThe final word is \"derinleştirdiğiniz,\" and it means \"that which you (plural/formal) have made become deep.\"\n\nAffixes used in order:\n- leş\n- tir\n- diğ\n- in\n- iz.\n\nNow we replace the root \"derin\" in \"derinleştirdiğiniz\" with our novel root \"risin\" to get the final answer \"risinleştirdiğiniz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>risinleştirdiğiniz</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: nıbıt\nDefinition: nıbıt means yapıt in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, den, da, ki, ler\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"nıbıt\" is defined to mean \"yapıt\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"yapıt\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. The affixes provided need to be appended in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar. Let's go through the affixes one by one:\n\n1. \"ler\" or \"lar\" - Plural suffix, used to pluralize nouns or adjectives. It must agree in vowel harmony with the word root.\n2. \"den\" - Ablative case suffix, indicating \"from\" or \"than\" something.\n3. \"da\" - Locative case suffix, indicating \"in\" or \"at\" something.\n4. \"ki\" - A suffix that forms an adjective from a noun or pronoun, often equivalent to the English \"that\" or \"which.\"\n\nGiven the word root \"yapıt\" (which means \"work\" or \"piece of art\"), we need to determine the correct order of affixes. The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"yapıt\" (root)\n2. \"lar\" (plural suffix, because \"yapıt\" ends with a back vowel, we use \"lar\" instead of \"ler\" for vowel harmony)\n3. \"da\" (locative case suffix, to be used after pluralizing the noun)\n4. \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix, which should come after the case suffix)\n5. \"den\" (ablative case suffix, which should be the last one as it indicates \"from\" the previously described location)\n\nSo, the constructed word is \"yapıtlardakilerden\".\n\nLet's list each affix used in the construction of that word:\n- \"lar\" (plural suffix)\n- \"da\" (locative case suffix)\n- \"ki\" (adjective-forming suffix)\n- \"den\" (ablative case suffix)\n\nWe have used each affix exactly once, and we have not used any extra affixes outside the provided list.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yapıt\" in \"yapıtlardakilerden\" with our novel root \"nıbıt\" to get the final answer \"nıbıtlardakilerden\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>nıbıtlardakilerden</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: rusvak\nDefinition: rusvak means kaynak in Turkish.\nAffixes: dır, mak, lan, ma, ta\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"rusvak\" is defined to mean \"kaynak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaynak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the correct order of affixes. The root word is \"kaynak,\" and the affixes are \"dır,\" \"mak,\" \"lan,\" \"ma,\" \"ta.\" \n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of affixes we have:\n- \"mak\" is a verbal infinitive marker.\n- \"lan\" is a reflexive/passive voice marker for verbs.\n- \"ma\" is a negation marker for verbs.\n- \"ta\" is a locative case marker for nouns.\n- \"dır\" is a verbal/nominal predicate marker for certainty/definiteness.\n\nThe correct order for affixes when constructing a verb would be to first turn the noun into a verb, then apply reflexivity/passivity if needed, followed by negation, and then the infinitive if we are creating a verb to be used as a noun or another part of speech. Then we can add the locative case and the predicate marker.\n\nSo, the correct order of affixes to form a verb from \"kaynak\" would be:\n1. \"lan\" to make it reflexive/passive.\n2. \"ma\" to negate it.\n3. \"mak\" to put it into the infinitive form.\n4. \"ta\" to indicate the state.\n5.\"dır\" to indicate the certainty.\n\nThe constructed word is \"kaynaklanmamaktadır,\" which means \"it is not in the state of not to originate from/be sourced from.\"\n\nNow we replace the root \"kaynak\" in \"kaynaklanmamaktadır\" with our novel root \"rusvak\" to get the final answer \"rusvaklanmamaktadır\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>rusvaklanmamaktadır</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: dondı\nDefinition: dondı means karşı in Turkish.\nAffixes: abil, eceğ, im, iz, laş\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dondı\" is defined to mean \"karşı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"karşı\" using the given affixes. First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"abil\" is a potential mood suffix that can be attached to verbs to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb.\n- \"eceğ\" is a future tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"im\" is a first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"iz\" is a first-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"laş\" is a reciprocal or reflexive verb-forming suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"karşı\" can function as a noun or an adjective. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb first. We can do this by adding the reflexive/reciprocal suffix \"laş\" to form \"karşılaş,\" which means \"to meet\" or \"to encounter.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the potential mood suffix \"abil\" to indicate the ability to perform the action of the verb. This gives us \"karşılaşabil,\" meaning \"can meet\" or \"can encounter.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the future tense suffix \"eceğ\" to indicate a future action. This results in \"karşılaşabileceğ,\" meaning \"will be able to meet\" or \"will be able to encounter.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"im\" and \"iz\" suffixes. Since \"im\" is for first-person singular and \"iz\" is for first-person plural, we need to add \"im\" and then \"iz\". Then this gives us \"karşılaşabileceğimiz,\" meaning \"We will be able to meet\" or \"We will be able to encounter.\"\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"karşı\" in \"karşılaşabileceğimiz\" with our novel root \"dondı\" to get the final answer \"dondılaşabileceğimiz\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dondılaşabileceğimiz</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: yama\nDefinition: yama means sına in Turkish.\nAffixes: n, ıyor, m, nız, sa\nAnswer:",

First, let's analyze the affixes and their functions:\n\n- \"n\" is a suffix that can be used for making nouns or for the second person singular possessive.\n- \"ıyor\" is the present continuous tense suffix for verbs.\n- \"m\" is the first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"nız\" is the second-person plural possessive or agreement suffix.\n- \"sa\" is a conditional or hypothetical mood suffix.\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. The root \"sına\" can be used as a verb base. To use the affixes correctly, we need to turn it into a verb in the present continuous tense. We do this by adding the present continuous tense suffix \"ıyor\" to form \"sınıyor,\" which means \"is testing\" or \"is examining.\"\n\n2. Next, we can add the first-person singular possessive or agreement suffix \"m\" to indicate \"my\" or \"I am.\" This gives us \"sınıyorum,\" meaning \"I am testing\" or \"I am examining.\"\n\n3. Now, we can add the conditional or hypothetical mood suffix \"sa\" to indicate a conditional state. This results in \"sınıyorsam,\" meaning \"if I am testing\" or \"if I am examining.\"\n\n4. Finally, we need to add the \"n\" and \"nız\" suffixes. Since \"n\" can be used for making nouns or for the second person singular possessive, and \"nız\" is for the second-person plural possessive, we need to add \"n\" to make it a noun and then \"nız\" to indicate \"your\" (plural). This gives us \"sınıyorsanız,\" meaning \"if you (plural) are testing\" or \"if you (plural) are examining.\"\n\nAll provided affixes are used, no extra affixes are included, and each affix is used exactly once.\n\nNow we replace the root \"sına\" in \"sınıyorsanız\" with our novel root \"yama\" to get the final answer \"yamıyorsanız\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yamıyorsanız</Answer>",

Given novel root \"mınar\" is defined to mean \"başar\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"başar\" using the given affixes.

Given novel root \"sagak\" is defined to mean \"kucak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kucak\" using the given affixes. First, let's determine the order of the affixes to create a grammatically correct word in Turkish. The root word \"kucak\" means \"lap\" or \"embrace\" in English. We need to follow Turkish grammar rules, which typically involve adding suffixes in a certain order, such as making the word plural, then adding tense, case, etc.\n\n1. kucak + la = kucakla (embrace with)\n2. kucakla + ma = kucaklama (do not embrace)\n3. kucaklama + dık = kucaklamadık (we did not embrace)\n4. kucaklamadık + lar = kucaklamadıklar (those that we did not embrace)\n5. kucaklamadıklar + ın = kucaklamadıkların (of those that we did not embrace)\n6. kucaklamadıkların + ı = kucaklamadıklarını (those that you did not embrace - accusative case)\n\nNow we have a grammatically correct word in Turkish. Each affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kucak\" in \"kucaklamadıklarını\" with our novel root \"sagak\" to get the final answer \"sagaklamadıklarını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>sagaklamadıklarını</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: dımyı\nDefinition: dımyı means kaygı in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ma, ı, ma, ın, lan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dımyı\" is defined to mean \"kaygı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaygı\" using the given affixes. First, let's list the affixes provided:\n\n1. lar\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ı\n4. ma (second occurrence)\n5. ın\n6. lan\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\" to make it a verb: kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamanın\n6. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamanını\n7. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamanınlar\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the plural affix \"lar\" cannot be directly added to the possessive form in Turkish. The correct order should be:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\": kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamalar\n6. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamaların\n7. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamalarını\n\nThe correct word constructed by using each affix exactly once and in a grammatically correct order. All affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kaygı\" in \"kaygılanmamalarını\" with our novel root \"dımyı\" to get the final answer \"dımyılanmamalarını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dımyılanmamalarını</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: yanmu\nDefinition: yanmu means sorgu in Turkish.\nAffixes: i, la, dik, ler, ni, yabil\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"yanmu\" is defined to mean \"sorgu\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"sorgu\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"sorgu\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar.\n\n1. \"sorgu\" (interrogation)\n2. \"sorgu\" + \"la\" = \"sorgula\" (interrogate)\n3. \"sorgula\" + \"yabil\" = \"sorgulayabil\" (can interrogate)\n4. \"sorgulayabil\" + \"dik\" = \"sorgulayabildik\" (we were able to interrogate)\n5. \"sorgulayabildik\" + \"i\" = \"sorgulayabildiği\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate)\n6. \"sorgulayabildiği\" + \"ni\" = \"sorgulayabildiğini\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate - accusative case, often used to indicate direct object of a verb)\n7. \"sorgulayabildiğini\" + \"ler\" = \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" (that they were able to interrogate - plural)\n\nNow we replace the root \"sorgu\" in \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" with our novel root \"yanmu\" to get the final answer \"yanmulayabildiklerini\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yanmulayabildiklerini</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: menen\nDefinition: menen means yen in Turkish.\nAffixes: yeceğ, me, e, i, ni, il\nAnswer:",

Given novel root \"garak\" is defined to mean \"bırak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"bırak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will start with the root \"bırak\" and then add the affixes in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. Root: bırak\n2. Future tense: ecek (bırakacak)\n3. Ability mood: abil (bırakabilecek)\n4. Passive voice: ıl (bırakılabilecek)\n5. Third person plural: ler (bırakılabilecekler)\n6. Accusative case: i (bırakılabilecekleri)\n7.

Given novel root \"sagak\" is defined to mean \"kucak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kucak\" using the given affixes. First, let's determine the order of the affixes to create a grammatically correct word in Turkish. The root word \"kucak\" means \"lap\" or \"embrace\" in English. We need to follow Turkish grammar rules, which typically involve adding suffixes in a certain order, such as making the word plural, then adding tense, case, etc.\n\n1. kucak + la = kucakla (embrace with)\n2. kucakla + ma = kucaklama (do not embrace)\n3. kucaklama + dık = kucaklamadık (we did not embrace)\n4. kucaklamadık + lar = kucaklamadıklar (those that we did not embrace)\n5. kucaklamadıklar + ın = kucaklamadıkların (of those that we did not embrace)\n6. kucaklamadıkların + ı = kucaklamadıklarını (those that you did not embrace - accusative case)\n\nNow we have a grammatically correct word in Turkish. Each affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kucak\" in \"kucaklamadıklarını\" with our novel root \"sagak\" to get the final answer \"sagaklamadıklarını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>sagaklamadıklarını</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: dımyı\nDefinition: dımyı means kaygı in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ma, ı, ma, ın, lan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dımyı\" is defined to mean \"kaygı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaygı\" using the given affixes. First, let's list the affixes provided:\n\n1. lar\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ı\n4. ma (second occurrence)\n5. ın\n6. lan\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\" to make it a verb: kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamanın\n6. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamanını\n7. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamanınlar\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the plural affix \"lar\" cannot be directly added to the possessive form in Turkish. The correct order should be:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\": kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamalar\n6. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamaların\n7. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamalarını\n\nThe correct word constructed by using each affix exactly once and in a grammatically correct order. All affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kaygı\" in \"kaygılanmamalarını\" with our novel root \"dımyı\" to get the final answer \"dımyılanmamalarını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dımyılanmamalarını</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: yanmu\nDefinition: yanmu means sorgu in Turkish.\nAffixes: i, la, dik, ler, ni, yabil\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"yanmu\" is defined to mean \"sorgu\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"sorgu\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"sorgu\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar.\n\n1. \"sorgu\" (interrogation)\n2. \"sorgu\" + \"la\" = \"sorgula\" (interrogate)\n3. \"sorgula\" + \"yabil\" = \"sorgulayabil\" (can interrogate)\n4. \"sorgulayabil\" + \"dik\" = \"sorgulayabildik\" (we were able to interrogate)\n5. \"sorgulayabildik\" + \"i\" = \"sorgulayabildiği\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate)\n6. \"sorgulayabildiği\" + \"ni\" = \"sorgulayabildiğini\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate - accusative case, often used to indicate direct object of a verb)\n7. \"sorgulayabildiğini\" + \"ler\" = \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" (that they were able to interrogate - plural)\n\nNow we replace the root \"sorgu\" in \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" with our novel root \"yanmu\" to get the final answer \"yanmulayabildiklerini\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yanmulayabildiklerini</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: keninmel\nDefinition: keninmel means mükemmel in Turkish.\nAffixes: tir, ebil, leş, iz, eceğ, im\nAnswer:",

We will append the affixes to the root \"örnek\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"örnek\" (example)\n2. \"örnek\" + \"len\" = \"örneklen\" (to be exemplified)\n3. \"örneklen\" + \"ebil\" = \"örneklen(e)bil\" (can be exemplified)\n4. \"örneklen(e)bil\" + \"ir\" = \"örneklen(e)bilir\" (it can be exemplified)\n5. \"örneklen(e)bilir\" + \"dir\" = \"örneklen(e)bilirdir\" (it is probable that it can be exemplified)\n6. \"örneklen(e)bilirdir\" + \"in\" = \"örneklen(e)bilirdirin\" (your probable can be exemplified)\n7. \"örneklen(e)bilirdirin\" + \"il\" = \"örneklen(e)bilirdirilin\" (it is probable that your can be exemplified)\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the affix \"il\" does not fit grammatically after \"dirin\". The correct order should be:\n\n1. \"örnek\" (example)\n2. \"örnek\" + \"len\" = \"örneklen\" (to be exemplified)\n3. \"örneklen\" + \"ebil\" = \"örneklen(e)bil\" (can be exemplified)\n4. \"örneklen(e)bil\" + \"ir\" = \"örneklen(e)bilir\" (it can be exemplified)\n5. \"örneklen(e)bilir\" + \"il\" = \"örneklen(e)biliril\" (it can be exemplified - passive voice)\n6. \"örneklen(e)biliril\" + \"dir\" = \"örneklen(e)bilirildir\" (it is certain that it can be exemplified)\n7. \"örneklen(e)bilirildir\" + \"in\" = \"örneklen(e)bilirildirin\" (it is certain that it can be exemplified - belonging to you)\n\nThe correct word constructed by using each affix exactly once and in a grammatically correct order. All affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"örnek\" in \"örneklen(e)bilirildirin\" with our novel root \"ügrek\" to get the final answer \"ügreklen(e)bilirildirin\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>ügreklen(e)bilirildirin</Answer>",

Given novel root \"garak\" is defined to mean \"bırak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"bırak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will start with the root \"bırak\" and then add the affixes in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. Root: bırak\n2. Future tense: ecek (bırakacak)\n3. Ability mood: abil (bırakabilecek)\n4. Passive voice: ıl (bırakılabilecek)\n5. Third person plural: ler (bırakılabilecekler)\n6. Accusative case: i (bırakılabilecekleri)\n7.

Given novel root \"sagak\" is defined to mean \"kucak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kucak\" using the given affixes. First, let's determine the order of the affixes to create a grammatically correct word in Turkish. The root word \"kucak\" means \"lap\" or \"embrace\" in English. We need to follow Turkish grammar rules, which typically involve adding suffixes in a certain order, such as making the word plural, then adding tense, case, etc.\n\n1. kucak + la = kucakla (embrace with)\n2. kucakla + ma = kucaklama (do not embrace)\n3. kucaklama + dık = kucaklamadık (we did not embrace)\n4. kucaklamadık + lar = kucaklamadıklar (those that we did not embrace)\n5. kucaklamadıklar + ın = kucaklamadıkların (of those that we did not embrace)\n6. kucaklamadıkların + ı = kucaklamadıklarını (those that you did not embrace - accusative case)\n\nNow we have a grammatically correct word in Turkish. Each affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kucak\" in \"kucaklamadıklarını\" with our novel root \"sagak\" to get the final answer \"sagaklamadıklarını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>sagaklamadıklarını</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: dımyı\nDefinition: dımyı means kaygı in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ma, ı, ma, ın, lan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dımyı\" is defined to mean \"kaygı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaygı\" using the given affixes. First, let's list the affixes provided:\n\n1. lar\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ı\n4. ma (second occurrence)\n5. ın\n6. lan\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\" to make it a verb: kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamanın\n6. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamanını\n7. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamanınlar\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the plural affix \"lar\" cannot be directly added to the possessive form in Turkish. The correct order should be:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\": kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamalar\n6. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamaların\n7.

Given novel root \"garak\" is defined to mean \"bırak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"bırak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will start with the root \"bırak\" and then add the affixes in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. Root: bırak\n2. Future tense: ecek (bırakacak)\n3. Ability mood: abil (bırakabilecek)\n4. Passive voice: ıl (bırakılabilecek)\n5. Third person plural: ler (bırakılabilecekler)\n6. Accusative case: i (bırakılabilecekleri)\n7.

Given novel root \"sagak\" is defined to mean \"kucak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kucak\" using the given affixes. First, let's determine the order of the affixes to create a grammatically correct word in Turkish. The root word \"kucak\" means \"lap\" or \"embrace\" in English. We need to follow Turkish grammar rules, which typically involve adding suffixes in a certain order, such as making the word plural, then adding tense, case, etc.\n\n1. kucak + la = kucakla (embrace with)\n2. kucakla + ma = kucaklama (do not embrace)\n3. kucaklama + dık = kucaklamadık (we did not embrace)\n4. kucaklamadık + lar = kucaklamadıklar (those that we did not embrace)\n5. kucaklamadıklar + ın = kucaklamadıkların (of those that we did not embrace)\n6. kucaklamadıkların + ı = kucaklamadıklarını (those that you did not embrace - accusative case)\n\nNow we have a grammatically correct word in Turkish. Each affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kucak\" in \"kucaklamadıklarını\" with our novel root \"sagak\" to get the final answer \"sagaklamadıklarını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>sagaklamadıklarını</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: dımyı\nDefinition: dımyı means kaygı in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ma, ı, ma, ın, lan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dımyı\" is defined to mean \"kaygı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaygı\" using the given affixes. First, let's list the affixes provided:\n\n1. lar\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ı\n4. ma (second occurrence)\n5. ın\n6. lan\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\" to make it a verb: kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamanın\n6. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamanını\n7. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamanınlar\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the plural affix \"lar\" cannot be directly added to the possessive form in Turkish. The correct order should be:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\": kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamalar\n6. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamaların\n7. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamalarını\n\nThe correct word constructed by using each affix exactly once and in a grammatically correct order. All affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kaygı\" in \"kaygılanmamalarını\" with our novel root \"dımyı\" to get the final answer \"dımyılanmamalarını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dımyılanmamalarını</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: yanmu\nDefinition: yanmu means sorgu in Turkish.\nAffixes: i, la, dik, ler, ni, yabil\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root.

The correct order should be:\n   - \"yaşa + mış + lar + ımız + lık + ın\" - the state/quality of our lives (plural possessive)\n\nThe final constructed word is \"yaşamışlarımızlıkın\".\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"yaşa\" in \"yaşamışlarımızlıkın\" with our novel root \"rora\" to get the final answer \"roramışlarımızlıkın\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>roramışlarımızlıkın</Answer>",

Given novel root \"garak\" is defined to mean \"bırak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"bırak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will start with the root \"bırak\" and then add the affixes in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. Root: bırak\n2. Future tense: ecek (bırakacak)\n3. Ability mood: abil (bırakabilecek)\n4. Passive voice: ıl (bırakılabilecek)\n5. Third person plural: ler (bırakılabilecekler)\n6. Accusative case: i (bırakılabilecekleri)\n7.

Given novel root \"sagak\" is defined to mean \"kucak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kucak\" using the given affixes. First, let's determine the order of the affixes to create a grammatically correct word in Turkish. The root word \"kucak\" means \"lap\" or \"embrace\" in English. We need to follow Turkish grammar rules, which typically involve adding suffixes in a certain order, such as making the word plural, then adding tense, case, etc.\n\n1. kucak + la = kucakla (embrace with)\n2. kucakla + ma = kucaklama (do not embrace)\n3. kucaklama + dık = kucaklamadık (we did not embrace)\n4. kucaklamadık + lar = kucaklamadıklar (those that we did not embrace)\n5. kucaklamadıklar + ın = kucaklamadıkların (of those that we did not embrace)\n6. kucaklamadıkların + ı = kucaklamadıklarını (those that you did not embrace - accusative case)\n\nNow we have a grammatically correct word in Turkish. Each affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kucak\" in \"kucaklamadıklarını\" with our novel root \"sagak\" to get the final answer \"sagaklamadıklarını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>sagaklamadıklarını</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: dımyı\nDefinition: dımyı means kaygı in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ma, ı, ma, ın, lan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dımyı\" is defined to mean \"kaygı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaygı\" using the given affixes. First, let's list the affixes provided:\n\n1. lar\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ı\n4. ma (second occurrence)\n5. ın\n6. lan\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\" to make it a verb: kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamanın\n6. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamanını\n7. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamanınlar\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the plural affix \"lar\" cannot be directly added to the possessive form in Turkish. The correct order should be:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\": kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamalar\n6. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamaların\n7. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamalarını\n\nThe correct word constructed by using each affix exactly once and in a grammatically correct order. All affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kaygı\" in \"kaygılanmamalarını\" with our novel root \"dımyı\" to get the final answer \"dımyılanmamalarını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dımyılanmamalarını</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: yanmu\nDefinition: yanmu means sorgu in Turkish.\nAffixes: i, la, dik, ler, ni, yabil\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"yanmu\" is defined to mean \"sorgu\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"sorgu\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"sorgu\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar.\n\n1. \"sorgu\" (interrogation)\n2. \"sorgu\" + \"la\" = \"sorgula\" (interrogate)\n3. \"sorgula\" + \"yabil\" = \"sorgulayabil\" (can interrogate)\n4. \"sorgulayabil\" + \"dik\" = \"sorgulayabildik\" (we were able to interrogate)\n5. \"sorgulayabildik\" + \"i\" = \"sorgulayabildiği\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate)\n6. \"sorgulayabildiği\" + \"ni\" = \"sorgulayabildiğini\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate - accusative case, often used to indicate direct object of a verb)\n7. \"sorgulayabildiğini\" + \"ler\" = \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" (that they were able to interrogate - plural)\n\nNow we replace the root \"sorgu\" in \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" with our novel root \"yanmu\" to get the final answer \"yanmulayabildiklerini\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yanmulayabildiklerini</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: ıdya\nDefinition: ıdya means uğra in Turkish.\nAffixes: dan, ın, tır, ş, ıcı, lığ\nAnswer:",

Your task is to construct a grammatically correct word by appending the given affixes to the root. Use each affix exactly once. After forming a word, list each affix used in the construction of that word to verify adherence to the rules. Check the following: Ensure no affix is used more than once, confirm that all provided affixes are used, verify that no extra affixes outside the provided list are included. Think step by step and then provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>correctword</Answer>.\n\nExample 1:\nWord root: mınar\nDefinition: mınar means başar in Turkish.\nAffixes: ımız, a, ma, lar, la, dık\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"mınar\" is defined to mean \"başar\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"başar\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"başar\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"başar\" (root) - to succeed\n2. \"başar + a\" - to be able to suceed\n3. \"başar + a + ma\" (negation) - not to succeed\n4. \"başar + a + ma + dık\" (past tense for negative) - we could not succeed\n5. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar\" (first person plural) - this is redundant since \"ımız\" already indicates first person plural, but in Turkish, sometimes double plural markers are used for emphasis or collective meaning\n6. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar + ımız\" (plural suffix) - the ones where we could not succeed\n7. \"başar + a + ma + dık + lar + ımız + la\" (instrumental/comitative case) - with the ones where we could not succeed\n\nThe final constructed word is \"başaramadıklarımızla\".\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"başar\" in \"başaramadıklarımızla\" with our novel root \"mınar\" to get the final answer \"mınaramadıklarımızla\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>mınaramadıklarımızla</Answer>\n\nExample 2:\nWord root: garak\nDefinition: garak means bırak in Turkish.\nAffixes: ecek, abil, ıl, ler, i, ni\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"garak\" is defined to mean \"bırak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"bırak\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will start with the root \"bırak\" and then add the affixes in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. Root: bırak\n2. Future tense: ecek (bırakacak)\n3. Ability mood: abil (bırakabilecek)\n4. Passive voice: ıl (bırakılabilecek)\n5. Third person plural: ler (bırakılabilecekler)\n6. Accusative case: i (bırakılabilecekleri)\n7. Genitive case: ni (bırakılabileceklerini)\n\nNow, let's put them all together:\n\nbırak + abil + ecek + ıl + ler + i + ni = bırakılabileceklerini\n\nEach affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"bırak\" in \"bırakılabileceklerini\" with our novel root \"garak\" to get the final answer \"garakılabileceklerini\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>garakılabileceklerini</Answer>\n\nExample 3:\nWord root: sagak\nDefinition: sagak means kucak in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ın, ı, la, dık, ma\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"sagak\" is defined to mean \"kucak\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kucak\" using the given affixes. First, let's determine the order of the affixes to create a grammatically correct word in Turkish. The root word \"kucak\" means \"lap\" or \"embrace\" in English. We need to follow Turkish grammar rules, which typically involve adding suffixes in a certain order, such as making the word plural, then adding tense, case, etc.\n\n1. kucak + la = kucakla (embrace with)\n2. kucakla + ma = kucaklama (do not embrace)\n3. kucaklama + dık = kucaklamadık (we did not embrace)\n4. kucaklamadık + lar = kucaklamadıklar (those that we did not embrace)\n5. kucaklamadıklar + ın = kucaklamadıkların (of those that we did not embrace)\n6. kucaklamadıkların + ı = kucaklamadıklarını (those that you did not embrace - accusative case)\n\nNow we have a grammatically correct word in Turkish. Each affix is used exactly once, all provided affixes are used, and no extra affixes are included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kucak\" in \"kucaklamadıklarını\" with our novel root \"sagak\" to get the final answer \"sagaklamadıklarını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>sagaklamadıklarını</Answer>\n\nExample 4:\nWord root: dımyı\nDefinition: dımyı means kaygı in Turkish.\nAffixes: lar, ma, ı, ma, ın, lan\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"dımyı\" is defined to mean \"kaygı\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"kaygı\" using the given affixes. First, let's list the affixes provided:\n\n1. lar\n2. ma (first occurrence)\n3. ı\n4. ma (second occurrence)\n5. ın\n6. lan\n\nNow, let's construct the word step by step:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\" to make it a verb: kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamanın\n6. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamanını\n7. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamanınlar\n\nHowever, the last step is incorrect because the plural affix \"lar\" cannot be directly added to the possessive form in Turkish. The correct order should be:\n\n1. Start with the root: kaygı\n2. Add the causative affix \"lan\": kaygılan\n3. Add the negation affix \"ma\" (first occurrence): kaygılanma\n4. Add the potential affix \"ma\" (second occurrence): kaygılanmama\n5. Add the plural affix \"lar\": kaygılanmamalar\n6. Add the possessive affix \"ın\": kaygılanmamaların\n7. Add the accusative affix \"ı\": kaygılanmamalarını\n\nThe correct word constructed by using each affix exactly once and in a grammatically correct order. All affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"kaygı\" in \"kaygılanmamalarını\" with our novel root \"dımyı\" to get the final answer \"dımyılanmamalarını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>dımyılanmamalarını</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: yanmu\nDefinition: yanmu means sorgu in Turkish.\nAffixes: i, la, dik, ler, ni, yabil\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"yanmu\" is defined to mean \"sorgu\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"sorgu\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"sorgu\" in a way that makes sense in Turkish grammar.\n\n1. \"sorgu\" (interrogation)\n2. \"sorgu\" + \"la\" = \"sorgula\" (interrogate)\n3. \"sorgula\" + \"yabil\" = \"sorgulayabil\" (can interrogate)\n4. \"sorgulayabil\" + \"dik\" = \"sorgulayabildik\" (we were able to interrogate)\n5. \"sorgulayabildik\" + \"i\" = \"sorgulayabildiği\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate)\n6. \"sorgulayabildiği\" + \"ni\" = \"sorgulayabildiğini\" (that he/she/it was able to interrogate - accusative case, often used to indicate direct object of a verb)\n7. \"sorgulayabildiğini\" + \"ler\" = \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" (that they were able to interrogate - plural)\n\nNow we replace the root \"sorgu\" in \"sorgulayabildiklerini\" with our novel root \"yanmu\" to get the final answer \"yanmulayabildiklerini\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>yanmulayabildiklerini</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: ımna\nDefinition: ımna means anla in Turkish.\nAffixes: na, ma, ş, sı, ma, ıl\nAnswer:",

We will append the affixes to the root \"hazır\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"hazır\" (ready)\n2. \"hazır\" + \"la\" = \"hazırla\" (prepare)\n3. \"hazırla\" + \"ma\" = \"hazırlama\" (do not prepare)\n4. \"hazırlama\" + \"yacağ\" = \"hazırlamayacağ\" (will not prepare)\n5. \"hazırlamayacağ\" + \"ım\" = \"hazırlamayacağım\" (I will not prepare)\n6. \"hazırlamayacağım\" + \"ız\" = \"hazırlamayacağımız\" (we will not prepare)\n7. \"hazırlamayacağımız\" + \"a\" = \"hazırlamayacağımıza\" (to our not preparing)\n8. \"hazırlamayacağımıza\" + \"ya\" = \"hazırlamayacağımızıya\" (to our not preparing - dative case)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word to verify adherence to the rules:\n\n- \"la\" (prepare)\n- \"ma\" (negation)\n- \"yacağ\" (future tense)\n- \"ım\" (first person plural possessive)\n- \"ız\" (plural)\n- \"a\" (dative case suffix)\n- \"ya\" (dative case suffix)\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the construction of the word. The affix \"ya\" is not typically used in conjunction with \"a\" to form a dative case in Turkish. The correct dative case suffix is either \"a\" or \"e\" depending on vowel harmony. Therefore, the correct construction should be \"hazırlamayacağımıza\" without the additional \"ya\".\n\nNow we replace the root \"hazır\" in \"hazırlamayacağımıza\" with our novel root \"kıdır\" to get the final answer \"kıdırlamayacağımıza\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>kıdırlamayacağımıza</Answer>",

We will append the affixes to the root \"duygu\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"duygu\" (emotion)\n2. \"duygu\" + \"sal\" = \"duygusal\" (emotional)\n3. \"duygusal\" + \"laş\" = \"duygusallaş\" (to become emotional)\n4. \"duygusallaş\" + \"tır\" = \"duygusallaştır\" (to make it become emotional)\n5. \"duygusallaştır\" + \"a\" = \"duygusallaştıra\" (be able to make it become emotional)\n6. \"duygusallaştıra\" + \"ma\" = \"duygusallaştırama\" (not be able to make it become emotional)\n7. \"duygusallaştırama\" + \"mak\" = \"duygusallaştıramamak\" (to not be able to make it become emotional - infinitive form)\n8. \"duygusallaştıramamak\" + \"tan\" = \"duygusallaştıramamaktan\" (from not being able to make it become emotional)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word to verify adherence to the rules:\n\n- \"sal\" (adjective making suffix)\n- \"laş\" (become)\n- \"tır\" (make/causative)\n- \"a\" (be able to)\n- \"ma\" (not be able to, negation)\n- \"mak\" (infinitive making suffix)\n- \"tan\" (ablative)\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"duygu\" in \"duygusallaştıramamaktan\" with our novel root \"koypu\" to get the final answer \"koypusallaştıramamaktan\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>koypusallaştıramamaktan</Answer>\n\nExample 5:\nWord root: udıl\nDefinition: udıl means akıl in Turkish.\nAffixes: ı, lan, yacağ, ıl, ma, ın, dır\nAnswer: To answer the question, we will first use the novel word's definition to derive an existing word in Turkish that has the same meaning and then replace the root in this derivation with the given novel root. Given novel root \"udıl\" is defined to mean \"akıl\", so let's first try to derive a new word from \"akıl\" using the given affixes. To construct a grammatically correct word in Turkish, we need to follow the rules of Turkish morphology and syntax. We will append the affixes to the root \"akıl\" in a logical order to create a meaningful word.\n\n1. \"akıl\" (intellect)\n2. \"akıl\" + \"lan\" = \"akıllan\" (become intelligent)\n3. \"akıllan\" + \"dır\" = \"akıllandır\" (to make it become intelligent)\n4. \"akıllandır\" + \"ıl\" = \"akıllandırıl\" (to be made become intelligent)\n5. \"akıllandırıl\" + \"ma\" = \"akıllandırılma\" (not be made become intelligent)\n6. \"akıllandırılma\" + \"yacağ\" = \"akıllandırılmayacağ\" (will not be made become intelligent)\n7. \"akıllandırılmayacağ\" + \"ın\" = \"akıllandırılmayacağın\" (of you not be made become intelligent)\n8. \"akıllandırılmayacağın\" + \"ı\" = \"akıllandırılmayacağını\" (you not be made become intelligent)\n\nNow, let's list each affix used in the construction of the word to verify adherence to the rules:\n\n- \"lan\" (become)\n- \"dır\" (make/causative)\n- \"ıl\" (passive)\n- \"ma\" (negation)\n- \"yacağ\" (future tense)\n- \"ın\" (possesive)\n- \"ı\" (accusative)\n\nAll affixes have been used exactly once, and no extra affixes have been included.\n\nNow we replace the root \"akıl\" in \"akıllandırılmayacağını\" with our novel root \"udıl\" to get the final answer \"udıllandırılmayacağını\".\n\nFinal answer: <Answer>udıllandırılmayacağını</Answer>\n\nExample 6:\nWord root: meney\nDefinition: meney means yüzey in Turkish.\nAffixes: il, tir, sel, leş, di, ir, ebil\nAnswer:",
