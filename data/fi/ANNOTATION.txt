Annotation guidelines/notes for Finnish
---------------------------------------

Definitions
-----------
Root: Part of a Finnish word that carries the core meaning (e.g. "kissa" in "kissoinensa")
Affix: a morpheme that is attached to a word root to form a new word, i.e. a prefix or a suffix
Prefix: an affix that is attached to the beginning of a word, i.e. before the root
Suffix: an affix that is attached to the end of a word, i.e. after the root
Lemma: the dictionary form of a word (not necesarily the same as the root)
    - not necessarily the same as the root
    - may include derivative affixes but not inflectional ones (this accounts for lexicalized forms)
        - e.g. "erityisrahoitus" -> "erityis-" is a derivative prefix, "rahoitus" is the root but the lemma is "erityisrahoitus"
        - e.g. certain lexicalized forms such as "osake" (share/stock) are kept as-is
            - especially ones like "keskiviikko" (wednesday)
        - e.g. ollutkaan becomes oll-ut-kaan

Process for annotation
----------------------
[x] 1. Initial surface segmentation was obtained using Omorfi
[x] 2. The annotator manually corrected the segmentation and identified the roots, prefixes and suffixes
[x] 3. Manual verification:
    [x] POS
    [x] Lemmas
    [x] sentence

All annotation was performed using `visidata`, `spacy` and `jq`.
    * Visidata version: saul.pw/VisiData v2.11.1
    * spaCy version: 3.7.4
    * jq version: jq-1.6

Annotator: Jonne Sälevä
